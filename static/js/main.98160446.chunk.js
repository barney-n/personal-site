Think for a second about your own life, what do you organise? Your clothes? Books? Passwords? Emails? Chances are you implicitly follow something similar to the system I will talk about below, and if not then this should help you get a better idea of whether its worth doing so.\n\nOne note before I dive in, I will use "organise" and "sort" interchangebly in the rest of this essay. I am aware they are not the same at the fundamental level but the concept I\'m getting acrossis the same with either action.\n\n## When should we organise?\n\nThis is essentially the same question as why should we organise, and the answer is straightforward: Organise when doing so is less effort than searching through the unorganised version. I first read about this idea in Algorithms to Live By (Christian and Griffiths). In the book the authors talk about the trade-off between sorting and searching and explain, as I have done, that it is only worth organising your "stuff" if it takes a long time to search through all that stuff relative to the amount of time it would take to sort. The authors don\'t give an explicit law to follow unlike in other chapters (my favourite remains the solution to finding a partner being 1/e), however the idea is still legitimate. When the cost of searching exceeds the cost of sorting, we should sort (and vise versa).\n\nConsider two situations: Firstly, when we can quickly sort something to make it much faster so search through, we should. Take your laundry for example. After washing your clothes, drying them, and taking them out of the drier, the cost to you of organising them then and there is much less than the cost of searching for the item you need when the time comes. On the other hand, when it takes a long time to sort something which is pretty easy to search even when unsorted, we shouldnt. In this case take your email inbox, there could be thousands of emails in there, but so long as you remember something about it such as who it was from or what was in the subject, then its not really worth spending the time to put each message into its respective folder.\n\n## How should we organise?\n\nUnorganised data is well represented by an Array. An Array is an ordered list of items (integers, strings, phone numbers, etc), and in some more modern programming languages such as Python they are called Lists. Arrays have an order but no separated organisation, and hence do well to represent the cost of disorganisation as follows: In order to check if an item is in the array you have no good strategy. Your best bet is just to check each item in any order that takes your fancy. This means that searching an Array twice as long will on average take you twice as long, the search algorithm is O(n).\n\nHowever, if we organise our data, then we can vastly improve this search efficiency. In Computer Science, one way to represent organisation that I have recently found interesting is through HashSets. A HashSet is an array of "buckets" which uses a hash function to decide which bucket each item goes into (a bucket in turn being an array). The hash function takes an item as the input, runs some operation on it and produces a hashcode, a number that correlates to a bucket in the HashSet. For example, a hash function might take the string "Dog", calculate the length as 3 and hence put the string in the 3rd bucket. The benefit of the hash function is that it can be run on items that we are searching for too. If we want to find "Dog" we know that we only need to look in the 3rd bucket, if its not there then its not in the HashSet. Intuitively this is no different to organising your clothes, where you have a hash function that takes inputs like t-shirts, shorts, socks and outputs locations like wardrobe, top drawer and bottom drawer (or perhaps floor, floor and floor in some cases).\n\nThis improvement in search efficiency allows for us to find items with an complexity closer to O(1), compared to O(n) previously, depending on the average number of items per bucket (known as the load factor).\n\nPut simply, you can find things faster if you know where you always put them.\n'},{id:"monty-hall",title:"Monty Hall",author:"No author given",date:"2020-09-05",content:"\nI remember coming across a quote somewhere that went like this: \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain something to a computer you don\u2019t understand it well enough\u201d. I\u2019ve since been looking for an interesting use case for this and have found one to satisfy my little wants in a problem called the Monty Hall problem, whose solution can often be tricky to comprehend (like it was for me). I won\u2019t bore you with an explanation of the problem however, I\u2019ll let Kevin Spacey in the gambling film 21 do it for me [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5nCtgcL4jU).\n\nSimply put, you choose a door out of the three available. A duff door is then opened, leaving you with two doors left, and you are asked if you want to swap your choice of door. The answer? Always.\n\nNow when I first saw this problem, I don\u2019t think I was alone in thinking that swapping doesn\u2019t matter because each door has a 1 in 3 chance of containing the prize. However, in this case first glances are deceiving. So in an effort to better understand the rationale behind swapping doors I explained the problem to my computer.\n\nThe following little program simulates the Monty Hall problem 10,000 times, calculating the win probabilities of both switching and not switching. Running this code will tell you that the probability of getting a car if you change is 0.67, while if you don\u2019t change its 0.33. As Ben tells us, you do in fact double your chances of getting a new car by switching.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\ndef simulate_game():\n    # Create 3 doors, one randomly containing a car and the other two containing goats\n    door_list = ['rand1', 'rand2', 'rand3']\n    door_list[door_list.index(np.random.choice(door_list))] = 'car'\n    for i in range(len(door_list)):\n        if door_list[i] != 'car':\n            door_list[i] = 'goat'\n    # Assume initially that the choice is made at random\n    choice_initial = np.random.choice(door_list)\n    # Host opens (removes) one goat\n    door_list.remove('goat')\n    # When given option: CHANGE\n    # We know that the two doors left include 1 goat and 1 car\n    final_choice_change = ''\n    if choice_initial  'goat':\n        choice_change = 'car'\n    else:\n        choice_change = 'goat'\n    # When given option: DONT CHANGE\n    choice_nochange = choice_initial\n    # Return binary success integers (1=win, 0=lose)\n    return [(choice_change'car')*1, (choice_nochange'car')*1]\ndf = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Change', 'Dont Change'])\nfor i in range(10000):\n    df.loc[len(df)] = simulate_game()\nprint(df.mean())\n```\n"},{id:"stoicism",title:"Stoicism",author:"No author given",date:"2020-08-08",content:"\n## A Brief History\n\nBefore diving into what Stoicism teaches, let's summarise where it came from. The Stoics were a group of Greek philosophers living around 300 BC, who practised one of the Hellenistic philosophies called Stoicism (another you might have heard of is Epicureanism). Being a Hellenistic philosophy essentially means it was borne out of the Hellenistic period of history in Greece, which was characterised by the dominant spread of Greek culture and philosophical thought across Europe, Africa and Asia. I\u2019m going to refrain from going into too much detail about the individuals behind Stoicism, instead focusing on the ideas. However, there are three that are certainly worth mentioning: Firstly, Marcus Aurelius. Called the \u201cphilosopher king\u201d, he was a Roman emperor in the 2nd century AD and known as one of the five great rulers. Secondly there is Lucius Seneca, also known as Seneca the Younger. He was a statesman and adviser who also tutored the famous Nero before he became emperor. Finally, Epictetus. Born as a slave but eventually freed, he used his time to study and preach Stoic philosophy, focussing on practical implementation as opposed to theoretical study. Each of these men has at least one fantastic book worth reading, which I\u2019ll elaborate on toward the end.\n\n## All About Control\n\nNow we know a little about who the Stoic were, let's dive into what they taught.\n\nStoicism looks at the world as follows: There are some things that are within our control, and others that are outside of it. Of the things that are within our control, we can view them as either good, bad or neither good nor bad. Consequently in our opinions and preferences, we should desire what is good, be averse to what is bad, and be indifferent to that which is neither good nor bad. On the other hand there are the things that are not within our control. These things can be neither good nor bad, hence we should be indifferent to anything that happens that is outside our control. Instead, being grateful by desiring whatever outcome occurs. The stoics use the phrase \u201camor fati\u201d (meaning \u201cto love your fate\u201d) to represent this concept.\n\nSo the instruction is to take action to change the things that you can change so that you achieve more of the good and less of the bad. Meanwhile, be grateful for whatever comes your way if you cannot control it by wanting what you have instead of having what you want.\n\n## The Good, the Bad and the Indifferent\n\nSo that sounds great, but what is the good and what is the bad? What should we desire and what should we avoid? The Stoics had some ideas on that too. Simply put, to achieve the good, an individual must act in accordance with nature. This means performing the role that they should be performing in their current time, place and life. They proposed that a person has many roles at any given time, ranging from the most fundamental to the most specific. The most fundamental role for anyone is that of a human being. The Stoics taught that we are all rational entities, and so in order to act in accordance with nature, we should both think and act in a purely rational manner. Beyond this, we should perform the more specific roles in our life, the meaning of which is best explained via an example. Suppose you are driving your family to the beach for a weekend away (and for simplicity assume I am talking about a man here). What are your roles then? First is the role of human being, requiring you to act and think rationally. Secondly, you are a father, whose role is to educate, love and care for his children. Thirdly you are a husband, and hence should love, respect and support your wife. Beyond this you are also a car driver, whose role is to get everyone in the car to the correct destination (the beach) in a safe and prompt fashion. Now, if you were to successfully do all of these things then you would be acting and thinking in accordance with nature, and this is what the Stoics would define as achieving the good.\n\nThe other side of the coin is the bad. This is largely the opposite of the good as you would expect, meaning any action or thought that is not in accordance with nature. In addition to this, avoidance of the bad involves the avoidance of things such as overindulgence, voluptuary, laziness, dishonour, lack of self control and disloyalty. Hence, to avoid the bad one must act and think in accordance with nature, while simultaneously avoiding instances and temptations of that which is inherently bad.\n\nFinally, many philosophers have concerned themselves with the characteristics of the good, including the famous Aristotle (have a read of Ethics if you are interested in his thoughts). Over time this has lead to an entire branch of philosophical thought on the subject, which in itself could be seamlessly integrated into the Stoic approach.\n\n## Stoicism in the Modern Day\n\nStoicism is clearly an ancient philosophy, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have needed to provide the little history lesson at the beginning. However, in the last few years the philosophy has grown in modern popularity as a result of modern authors publishing more accessible and readable interpretations than the originals. Take for example Ryan Holiday. I\u2019m going to confess I haven\u2019t read any of his books, but despite this I can clearly see how he has taken these ancient concepts and marketed them to those looking for more meaning or happiness in their lives today. Sadly I can\u2019t yet come to my own conclusion of how close his ideas are to those of the original texts, but if I ever read one of his books, I\u2019ll be sure to update this section to account for it.\n\nSecondly, the concepts of Stoicism that relate to control are some of the earliest observations of a concept that many people know more commonly as that of the locus of control. The idea is that those who focus on what is in their control, and believe that what happens to them is a result of their own actions tend to be more motivated, disciplined and happy in life than those who feel like everything in the world just happens to them. Sounds familiar right? Once again the ancient idea from the Stoics appears to have been re-marketed to fit the modern day world (although I have no evidence that the locus of control theory originated from Stoicism).\n\nFinally, the area of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is a branch of psychology that focusses on changing physical reactions to situations in the body by changing the thought processes underlying them. I first noticed this link when, during a session of my own, my therapist recommended that I read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (the Stoic emperor I mentioned during the history lesson). Since then I have noticed many parallels between the two areas, mostly to do with focussing on what is within your control, being grateful for that which is not, and acting in accordance with a set of values that you fully believe in.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nNow let's wrap up. The Stoicism elevator pitch is this: When something is within your control, where you can, act in accordance with your current role well and take action to move yourself toward what is good, meanwhile if something is outside of your control, hold no hopes on the outcome and simply be grateful for what occurs.\n\nIf this sounds like something you\u2019re interested in then there is a limit to how much more I can tell you about it, and as with almost anything, learning the original foundations of the topic will serve you best. Consequently I believe it\u2019s almost always the best move to read the original texts and form your own opinions before you read a modern interpretation of them. Because of this, I would recommend you start off with what I\u2019m going to call the \u201cbig three\u201d: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Letters from a Stoic by Seneca, and the Discourses and Handbook of Epictetus. These are the three books that I read before writing this, and they offer quite different views of the philosophy given the different backgrounds of each individual.\n"},{id:"accountability",title:"Accountability",author:"No author given",date:"2020-08-02",content:"\nAccountability is a subtle but highly effective motivator. It thrives on the social nature of human beings, using our desire for approval to ensure we get tasks done. At its core accountability is about knowing you are responsible for something, be it the health of your child, the profit of your business or the content on your website. The accountability effect is an observation based on this, namely, that we are more motivated and diligent in our actions and thoughts when we know we are accountable for them. My personal thoughts on the reason for the effectiveness of the accountability effect are that it makes us feel important, and this sense of importance (or the fear of losing it) can ensure that we complete tasks we are accountable for.\n\nBefore I go any further it is worth mentioning, despite dealing with the same topic, my discussion of the accountability effect is not based on the book by the same name. The opinions below are my own on the subject, and I have neither read the book nor know what it says about accountability. With that, onto the rest.\n\n## Transferring Accountability\n\nRichard Feynman has a great quote that goes like this: \u201cThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool\u201d. Now he meant this largely in relation to the solving of scientific problems, but I think it applies in a wider sense to any opinion we have or action we plan to take. We can all admit at some point to rationalising an action we have taken when we knew at the time it wasn\u2019t right. Common examples of this are \u201cI\u2019ll do a longer workout so I can have the cake\u201d and \u201cI shouldn\u2019t really start studying yet anyway, there\u2019s loads of time\u201d. These arguments work at the time, because we alone are inclined to believe them. However, they don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny when posed to any external counterparty.\n\nBuilding on this, there appear to me to be two main types of accountability, defined by whom we are accountable to. In the first type we are accountable to ourselves (let\u2019s call this \u201cinternal accountability\u201d), and in the second we are accountable to others (\u201cexternal accountability\u201d). In my experience, as well as what I have been reading, external accountability tends to be the stronger of the two, and so we can improve our effectiveness at certain tasks my transferring accountability from ourselves (internal) to somebody else (external). Put simply, this means taking tasks, actions, thoughts and anything else that you have been monitoring yourself and finding someone who you trust that you can make yourself accountable to.\n\nBear this in mind as we look at some examples.\n\n## Examples of Accountability Transfer\n\n### Starting a Blog\n\nIntellectual accountability (relating to your thoughts and opinions) is just as important as physical accountability (relating to your actions). Telling yourself you will learn a new topic or read around a certain area in order to know more about it is great, and personally I find learning new things one of the most satisfying things you can do. However, when left accountable to only ourselves, it can be hard to actually do anything about it, leaving our opinions weak and unstructured, having never had to fight their corner. There are many ways that you can solve this, go to a book club, talk to friends who are also interested in the same things, but one that is all the more common nowadays is to start a blog. This essentially involves airing your views, opinions and thoughts to anyone who happens to come across your site. That was my thinking when I started this blog, both to hold my opinions up to more global scrutiny, and to learn new concepts by explaining them. So, assuming at least one person reads my blog, I have successfully transferred accountability for my thoughts to them, and if nobody does, then fuck it - the world is flat and scientology is cool.\n\n### Dinner party\n\nSecondly, let\u2019s consider transferring accountability for your actions. Suppose you are interested in eating healthier but are struggling with doing so. You have two choices for what to do on Friday night; in the first you tell yourself you are going to cook a healthy meal, holding yourself personally accountable for doing so. In the second you invite your friends around, explicitly telling them that you\u2019re going to cook something containing avocados, vegetables and whatever quinoa is. Now, in which scenario are you more likely to end up cooking that meal? The answer for most people will be the dinner party, as your dinner guests will hold you accountable should they not enjoy a healthy meal on Friday.\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, this is a topic that has been researched by those much more intelligent than me, oftentimes under different names. For example, Robert Cialdini talks about something in his book Influence (highly recommended) called \u201cconsistency\u201d. This principle states that once people act in a certain way, they feel that other people expect them to continue acting in that way, imploring them to continue doing so in order to appear consistent. Practically speaking, Cialdini is (indirectly) saying that by acting in a certain way you are transferring some accountability for those actions to those around you. This is the same concept however, showing that we can use the transfer of accountability from ourselves to others to improve our motivation and diligence.\n\nGet in touch if you have any thoughts on the above.\n"}]},34:function(e){e.exports=[{id:"barbarian-days",title:"Barbarian Days",author:"William Finnegan",date:"2023-05-22",stars:"5",isbn:"9781594203473",content:"\nI really enjoyed this book. It fills you with a sense of child-like adventure. Finnegan spent his life scratching his itch for surfing. Chasing the best waves in the world. Along the way its clear he kept detailed journals. Because the depth he goes into when telling stories from his childhood and young adult years is what makes the book so great. It's an autiobiography, but the quality of the storytelling lends an element of fiction to it as well (as with all good biographies). \n\nFinnegan grew up in California but the family moved to Hawaii at a young age. Both great surfing destinations of course, and Hawaii seems to be the place that he really came into his own as an independent surfer. After leaving school and being in and out of university, he set off on a mission to circumnavigate the world, chasing the globes best waves with a friend of his, Bryan. After about 2 years of doing exactly that, he settled down in South Africa for a while to teach at a school and surf some of the local waves. Eventually he moved back home to California where he tells stories of the undergroud surfing scene there that most are unaware of. The book finishes up with him in New York, writing full time as a journalist and often running off to New York's (much colder) waves.\n\nThroughout the book a few things stick out.\n\n**A \"way of life\"**: The love of surfing has been a rare constant throughout his life. Over 40 years since starting, he will still drop what he is doing at a moment's notice and run off with a wetsuit to catch a wave in the freezing cold seas of New York. It really makes you want to find your own passion, whatever your own version of surfing is. \n\n**Risking it all for a wave**: Along a similar vein, the risks of injury that himself and his friends often took is impressive. A lifelong passion yes. But never anything more than the next wave. Surfers dont look at the sport as a whole very often. Instead they think \"is it worth it for this wave?\". The answer is almost always yes.\n\n**Surfing friendships**: Finnegan made new friends through surfing from the age of 14 all the way through to 40. Never short of a kind person to share the sport with.\n\n**Growth through travel**: By meeting new people and seeing new cultures, he clearly developed a new way of looking at the world. A more complete one. In moving to Hawaii with his family he had left western culture. And travelling in his 20s simply continued to widen his perspective. \n\n**Always writing**: This may not surprise many people, but as a budding writer and journalist he was always writing. Journals for his personal use. Articles for travel and surf magazines. A novel of his own. This shouldn't surprise that many, but it's worth noting that, as usual, the best way to do what you want to do professionally is to do a shit-load of it non-professionally first.

Thompson is a breath of fresh air and this comes through nowhere more clearly than in his letters. It\'s rare that the history of someones writing is documented so well from the early years of their life (this book starts with letters he wrote at 17, and ends in his 30s).\n\nIt\'s certainly not the perfect example of how to live. He continued to make the same mistakes many times, and made a lot of decisions that happened to work out for him but probably wouldn\'t in most cases. \n\nThat being said, it is certainly a lesson in living. You can\'t help but be inspired to do something more outrageous and different in your life as a result of reading the views of this man. \n\nFavourite quotes below:\n\n# Work\n- "Gonzo, he wrote, \u201cis a style of \u2018reporting based on William Faulkner\u2019s idea that the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism"\n- "Also, without the slightest exaggeration, I drink approximately 20 cups of coffee every 24 hours and manage to sleep about 5 hours a night."\n- "Instead of battling my environment, I enjoy my work tremendously and put in about 15 hours a day at it\u2014for the simple reason that I like to write."\n- "I just keep wandering around, doing all these things and not worrying about what the results will be.

A. Book. I've always struggled with recommending people books. Thats why I share what I myself have read instead of telling others what to read. But this book has made that question so easy to answer. It is my number one go to book to reccomend to people. It's empowering in it's idea of individuality, and motivates you to follow your own way in life as opposed to conforming into something that deep down you know you are not. \n\nHoward Roark is the main character, and exemplifies all the ideas that Rand is writing about perfectly. He would undoubtedly be the most independent person you have ever met, if you were so lucky. \n\nThe essential essence of the book is around moving society forward through individuals making completely self interested decisions about the way they think the world should be. In this case it is Roark and his modernist style of architecture. It mocks what Rand calls the 'second handers' that simply mirror the opinions of others and follow the crowd. \n\nDont be a second hander.\n\n## Highlights\n\n\"It's for four years. But, on the other hand, Guy Francon offered me a job with him some time ago. Today he said it's still open. And I don't know which to take.\" Roark looked at him; Roark's fingers moved in slow rotation, beating\nagainst the steps. \"If you want my advice, Peter,\" he said at last, \"you've made a mistake already. By asking me. By asking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work. Don't you know what you want? How can you stand it, not to know?\" \"You see, that's what I admire about you, Howard. You always\nknow.\"\n\"Drop the compliments.\"\n\"But I mean it. How do you always manage to decide?\" \"How can you let others decide for you?\"\n\"But you see, I'm not sure, Howard. I'm never sure of myself. I don't know whether I'm as good as they all tell me I am. I wouldn't admit that to anyone but you. I think it's because you're always so sure that\nI...\" \"Petey!\" Mrs. Keating's voice exploded behind them. \"Petey, sweet- heart! What are you doing there?\"\nShe stood in the doorway, in her best dress of burgundy taffeta, happy\nand angry.\n\"And here I've been sitting all alone, waiting for you! What on earth are you doing on those filthy steps in your dress suit? Get up this minute! Come on in the house, boys. I've got hot chocolate and cookies ready for you.\"\n\"But, Mother, I wanted to speak to Howard about something impor- tant,\" said Keating. But he rose to his feet.\nShe seemed not to have heard. She walked into the house. Keating followed.\nRoark looked after them, shrugged, rose and went in also.\nMrs. Keating settled down in an armchair, her stiff skirt crackling. \"Well?\" she asked. \"What were you two discussing out there?\"\nKeating fingered an ash tray, picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then, ignoring her, turned to Roark.\n\"Look, Howard, drop the pose,\" he said, his voice high. \"Shall I junk the scholarship and go to work, or let Francon wait and grab the Beaux- Arts to impress the yokels? What do you think?\"\nSomething was gone. The one moment was lost.\n\"Now, Petey, let me get this straight...\" began Mrs. Keating. \"Oh, wait a minute, Mother! . . . Howard, I've got to weigh it care fully. It isn't everyone who can get a scholarship like that. You're pretty\n\n---\nIt was right and it was good, that house growing under his hand, because men were still worshiping the masters who had done it before him. He did not have to wonder, to fear or to take chances; it had been done for him.\n\n---\n\"You call that freedom?\"\n\"To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing.\" \"What if you found something you wanted?\"\n\"I won't find it. I won't choose to see it. It would be part of that lovely world of yours. I'd have to share it with all the rest of you-and I wouldn't. You know, I never open again any great book I've read and loved. It hurts me to think of the other eyes that have read it and of what they were. Things like that can't be shared. Not with people like that.\"\n\n---\nThere was no such person as Mrs. Wayne Wilmot; there was only a shell containing the opinions of her friends, the picture postcards she had seen, the novels of country squires she had read; \n\n---\n\"Don't you know that most people take most things because that's what's given them, and they have no opinion whatever? Do you wish to be guided by what they expect you to think they think or by your own judgment?\"\n\n---\nKeating let himself be carried by the torrent. He needed the people and the clamor around him. There were no questions and no doubts when he stood on a platform over a sea of faces; the air was heavy, compact, saturated with a single solvent-admiration; there was no room for anything else. He was great; great as the number of people who told him so. He was right; right as the number of people who believed it. He looked at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself born in them, he saw himself being granted the gift of life. That was Peter Keating, that, the reflection in those staring pupils, and his body was only its reflection.\n\n---\n\"It is so commonplace,\" she drawled, \"to be understood by every- body.\"\n\n---\nWhat is kinder-to believe the best of people and burden them with a nobility beyond their endurance or to see them as they are, and accept it because it makes them comfortable? Kindness being more important than justice, of course.\"\n\n---\n\"It's good to suffer. Don't complain. Bear, bow, accept-and be grateful that God has made you suffer. For this makes you better than the people who are laughing and happy. If you don't understand this, don't try to understand. Everything bad comes from the mind, because the mind asks too many questions. It is blessed to believe, not to under- stand. So if you didn't get passing grades, be glad of it. It means that you are better than the smart boys who think too much and too easily.\"\n\n---\nAnd as Roark looked at him, he added: \"Don't worry. They're all against me. But I have one advantage: they don't know what they want.\nI do.\"\n\n---\n\"That's true,\" whispered Keating. He would not have admitted it to anyone else.\n\"You missed the beautiful pride of utter selflessness. Only when you learn to deny your ego, completely, only when you learn to be amused by such piddling sentimentalities as your little sex urges-only then will achieve the greatness which I have always expected of you.\"\nyou \"You... you believe that about me, Ellsworth? You really do?\"\n\"I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't. But to come back to love.\n\n---\n\"Yes, if it's your chief concern. Don't you see how egotistical it is? To\nhell with everybody so long as I'm virtuous.\"\n\n---\nHe recognized nothing but the accuracy of his own judgment. \n\n---\nThere was no order in his read- ing; but there was order in what remained of it in his mind.\n\n---\nWynand showed no interest in the previous standing of his prey. He showed no interest in men of glittering success who had commercialized their careers and held no particular beliefs of any kind. His victims had a single attribute in common: their immacu- late integrity.\n\n---\nBut you have to flatter people whom you despise in order to impress other people who despise you.\"\n\n---\n\"I'd rather...\" Then he cried: \"I'd rather you'd express an opinion,\nGod damn it, just once!\" She asked, in the same level monotone: \"Whose opinion, Peter? Gor- don Prescott's? Ralston Holcombe's? Ellsworth Toohey's?\"\n\n---\n\"You're beginning to see, aren't you, Peter? Shall I make it clearer? You never wanted me to be real. You never wanted anyone to be. But you didn't want me to show it. You wanted an act to help your act-a beautiful, complicated act, all twists, trimmings and words. All words. You didn't like what I said about Vincent Knowlton. You liked it when I said the same thing under cover of virtuous sentiments. You didn't want me to believe. You only wanted me to convince you that I be- lieved. My real soul, Peter? It's real only when it's independent-you've discovered that, haven't you? It's real only when it chooses curtains and desserts you're right about that-curtains, desserts and religions, Peter, and the shapes of buildings. But you've never wanted that. You wanted a mirror. People want nothing but mirrors around them. To reflect them while they're reflecting too. You know, like the senseless infinity you get from two mirrors facing each other across a narrow passage. Usually in the more vulgar kind of hotels. Reflections of reflec- tions and echoes of echoes. No beginning and no end. No center and no purpose. I gave you what you wanted. I became what you are, what your friends are, what most of humanity is so busy being-only without the trimmings. I didn't go around spouting book reviews to hide my emptiness of judgment-I said I had no judgment. I didn't borrow de- signs to hide my creative impotence-I created nothing. I didn't say that equality is a noble conception and unity the chief goal of mankind-I just agreed with everybody. You call it death, Peter? That kind of death-I've imposed it on you and on everyone around us. But you- you haven't done that. People are comfortable with you, they like you, they enjoy your presence. You've spared them the blank death. Because you've imposed it-on yourself.\"\nHe said nothing. She walked away from him, and sat down again, waiting.\n\n---\nEvery building is like a person. Single and unrepeat- able.\"\n\n---\n\"It is a masterpiece,\" said Jules Fougler. \"I hope you will prove yourself worthy of it, Peter. It is the kind of play that depends upon what the members of the audience are capable of bringing with them into the theater. If you are one of those literal-minded people, with a dry soul and a limited imagination, it is not for you. But if you are a real human being with a big, big heart full of laughter, who has preserved the uncorrupted capacity of his childhood for pure emotion-you will find it an unforgettable experience.\"\n\n---\nMany stole Cameron's forms; few understood his thinking. \n\n---\nI would stand and say: I am Gail Wynand, the man who has committed every crime except the foremost one: that of ascribing futility to the wonderful fact of existence and seeking justification beyond myself. This is my pride: that now, thinking of the end, I do not cry like all the men of my age: but what was the use and the meaning? I was the use and the meaning, I, Gail Wynand. That I lived and that I acted.\n\n---\n\"Howard, I'm a parasite. I've been a parasite all my life. You de- signed my best projects at Stanton. You designed the first house I ever built. You designed the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. I have fed on you and on all the men like you who lived before we were born. The men who designed the Parthenon, the Gothic cathedrals, the first skyscrapers. If they hadn't existed, I wouldn't have known how to put stone on stone. In the whole of my life, I haven't added a new doorknob to what men have done before me. I have taken that which was not mine and given nothing in return. I had nothing to give. This is not an act, Howard, and I'm very conscious of what I'm saying. And I came here to ask you to save me again. If you wish to throw me out, do it now.\"\n\n---\n\"Howard - anything you ask. Anything. I'd sell my soul ...\"\n\"That's the sort of thing I want you to understand. To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That's what everybody does every hour of his life. If I asked you to keep your soul - would you understand why that is much harder?\"\n\n---\nBoth are only the means of my work. Peter, before you can do things for people, you must be the kind of man who can get things done. But to get things done, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences. The work, not the people. Your own action, not any possible object of your charity. I'll be glad if people who need it find a better manner of living in a house I designed. But that's not the motive of my work. Nor my reason. Nor my reward.\"\n\n---\nThe only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself. My work done my way. \n\n---\n\"You'll get everything society can give a man. You'll keep all the\nmoney. You'll take any fame or honor anyone might want to grant. You'll accept such gratitude as the tenants might feel. And I-I'll take what nobody can give a man, except himself. I will have built Cort- landt.\"\n\n---\nI never think of myself in relation to anyone else. \n\n---\n\"I've looked at him-at what's left of him-and it's helped me to\nunderstand. He's paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he's been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness-in other people's eyes. Fame, admiration, envy-all that which comes from others. Oth- ers dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn't want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn't want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There's your actual selflessness. It's his ego that he's betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.\"\n\n---\n\"Aren't they all acting on a selfish motive - to be noticed, liked, admired?\"\n\n\"- by others. At the price of their own self respect. In the realm of great important - the realm of values, of judgement, of spirit, of thought - they place others abve self, in the exact manner which altruism demands. A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesnt need it\"\n\n...\n\n\"That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They're concerned only with people. They dont ask 'Is this true?' They ask 'Is this what others think is true?' Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. What would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists. You dont think through anothers brain and you dont work through anothers hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent judgement, you suspent consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation. Anchored to nothing\"\n\n---\nIf any man stopped and asked himself whether he's ever held a truly personal desire, he'd find the answer. He'd see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other men. He's not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion-prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can't say about a single thing: 'This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.' Then he wonders why he's unhappy. Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to be touched. \n\n---\nA self-sufficient ego.\n\n---\n\"We have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to recognize it,\" said another Wynand editorial. \"We have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that greatness is to be gauged by self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate virtue. Let's stop and think for a moment. Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convic- tions? The honesty of his feeling? The independence of his thought? But these are a man's supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. They, however, are above sacrificing to any cause or consideration whatsoever. Should we not, then, stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense? Self-sacrifice? But it is pre- cisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed. It is the unsacri- ficed self that we must respect in man above all.\"\n\n---\nToohey - \"The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. A world where the thought of each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought in the brain of his neigh- bor who'll have no thought of his own but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor who'll have no thought-and so on, Peter, around the globe. Since all must agree with all. A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who'll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who'll have no desires-around the globe, Peter. Since all must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that headless monster-prestige. \"\n\n---\n\nEvery single thing I told you? Isn't Europe swallowed already and we're stumbling on to follow? Everything I said is contained in a single word collectivism. And isn't that the god of our century? To act together. To think- together. To feel-together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. Divide and conquer-first. But then-unite and rule.\n\n---\nAnything may be betrayed, anyone may be forgiven. But not those who lack the courage of their own greatness. Alvah Scarret can be forgiven. He had nothing to betray. Mitchell Layton can be forgiven. But not I. I was not born to be a second-hander.\n\n---\nThe misery of knowing how strong and able one is in one's own mind, the radiant picture never to be made real. Dreams? Self-delusion? Or a murdered reality, unborn, killed by that corroding emotion without name - fear - need - dependence - hatred?\n\n---\n\"Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received-hatred. The great creators-the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors- stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. \n\n---\n\"And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement.\n\"Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. Animals obtain food by force. Man has no claws, no fangs, no horns, no great strength of muscle. He must plant his food or hunt it. To plant, he needs a process of thought. To hunt, he needs weapons, and to make weapons-a process of thought. From this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstrac- tion, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man-the function of his reasoning mind.\n\"But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary conse- quence. The primary act-the process of reason-must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred.\n\n---\nAnd here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways-by the independent work of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of others. \n\n---\n\n\"Degrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree of a man's independence, initiative and personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker and his worth as a man. Inde- pendence is the only gauge of human virtue and value. What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or hasn't done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity. There is no standard of personal dignity except independence.\n\n...\n\n\"The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, pro- vided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty, his thinking, his work. But it\ndoes not include the sphere of the gangster, the altruist and the dictator. \"A man thinks and works alone. \n\n---\n\nRoark - \"I do not recognise anyone's right to one minute of my life.

Hence scheduling is not important\n- If you have two machines (washing machine and drier)\n- Solutions\n\t- **Shortest Processing Time**: Start with the task that will be done fastest\n\t- Priority weighted to do list (Order by priority weight divided by time to complete)\n\t- Priority inheritance - If you have something low priority that needs to be done before something high priority, then it too is high priority\n- **Thrashing**\n\t- Context switching carries a cost, so minimising it is beneficial\n\t- Thrashing is excessive context switching, you should avoid this\n\t- Batching helps with this\n\t- So does rejecting new tasks\n- Metastablility\n\t- Not doing anything because you dont know what to do\n\t- Doing something always better than nothing\n\t- Pomodoros good for this (establish a minimum time to spend on something)\n\n## Bayes Rule\n- Laplace\'s law\n- Bayes Rule\n\t- P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)\n- Lindy Effect\n- Distributions (p. 142 good for this)\n\t- Normal --\x3e Average prediction\n\t- Power Law --\x3e Multiply prediction\n\t- Erlang --\x3e Additive prediction\n\n## Overfitting\n- Problem: **Bias variance tradeoff**\n- Solutions\n\t- Cross validation\n\t- Penalizing complexity\n\n\n## Relaxing\n- **Constraint relaxation**\n\t- Solve a similar problem with fewer constraints\n\t- *What would you do it you werent afraid?*\n\t- *What would you do if you couldnt fail?*\n\t- *What would you do if all jobs paid the same?*\n- Continuous relaxation\n- Lagrangean relaxation\n\n## Randomness\n- Sampling\n\t- Large enough samples represent data well\n\t- Collecting data is key: Make sure you have truly random samples first\n- Monte carlo method = Random simulation\n- Simulated annealing \n- Randomness for good\n\t- Randomness --\x3e Creativity\n\t- The idea of the **random wiki link** on your computer\n\n## Networking\n- All network communication starts with **protocols**\n- Eg. HTTP\n- "Packet switching"\n\t- Messages are atomised and input into a stream of data\n\t- Responses are sent as ACKs that show message has been received\n- "Exponential backoff" - Delay the next attempt to contact the person by double the delay last time you tried\n- Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD)\n\t- Add things\n\t- When you hit a threshold, cut off a certain % of them\n- Buffering\n\t- Prevents taildrop\n\t- Humans dont have taildrop\n\n\n## Game Theory\n- Recursion\n- "Levelling" in poker: Understanding the level your opponent is on and playing one level higher\n- Nash equilibria\n- **Algorithmic game theory** \n\t- About finding NEs using efficient algorithms\n\t- Takes into account not only the solution, but the computation effort of the players in finding the solution\n- Looking for dominant strategies\n- Nash equilibria are not always optimal\n- Mechanism design\n\t- Changing the rules of the game\n\t- Creating rules that you know will result in the behaviour you want\n\t- Evolution has done a lot of mechanism design (eg. Emotions)\n- Marriage is a prisoners dilemma problem\n- Information cascades\n\t- Rational theory of bubbles\n- Pure honesty: "If I design an algorithm that already optimises for you, you won\'t need to do anything"\n'},{id:"antifragile",title:"Antifragile",author:"Nassim Taleb",date:"2018-10-18",stars:"5",isbn:"9781400067824",content:'References: Antifragility | Risk\n\n## Antifragile: An Introduction\n- A little bit of something bad is good for you\n  - E.g Having a good competitor or using white noise to sleep\n- Information is antifragile\n- Certain jobs are more antifragile than others. Think of an author vs a CEO (Any press is good press for an author)\n- _Iatrogenics_: When a treatment causes more harm than good - I.e intervening in something had a negative impact\n  - For example a personal doctor will make you take lots of medication you don\u2019t need for the sake of na\xefve intervention\n- Fragility - You have more to lose than you do to gain, volatility hinders you\n- Antifragility - You have more to gain than you do to lose, volatility benefits you\n\n## Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility\n- Society relies on control\n- People want so much control that they become antifragile\n- *"Light control works, close control leads to overreaction"*\n- We vaccinate our children each year but do not do the same in other disciplines for adults/politicians\n- _Na\xefve Intervention_: Intervening just because you feel as though you should do something (Needing close control)\n- Modern society struggles to filter the signal from the noise - There is so much information going around and we aim to react to all of it, not just the important parts\n\n## A Non-Predictive View of the World\n- Stoicism in the modern day\n  - \\= "Someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking\n  - Stoicism is an antifragile philosophy of not controlling what needn\'t be controlled\n- Barbell strategy\n  - Aiming to survive before you thrive\n  - For example choosing a portfolio where you have 90% cash and 10% in volatile assets - You won\'t lose all your portfolio, which is a real possibility if you are in a 60/40 bond equity one\n\n## Optionality, Technology and the Intelligence of Antifragility\n- Optionality allows you to benefit from asymmetry and volatility\n- Having and creating more options mean that unexpected events in your life are now beneficial\n- Options have unlimited gain with a limited loss - This is a positive asymmetry that you should be exposing yourself to\n- "An option is the weapon of antifragility"\n- Technological advances come as a result of tinkering, of trial and error. I.e from antifragile researchers\n- **A lesson in disorder** - The best chapter\n  - Life education is not the same as classroom education\n  - You need to go out and read your own books which you found\n  - Meet people, have conversations\n  - Try new experiences\n  - School cannot teach you these things, but they are exactly what makes you antifragile and robust to life\n  - Reading is an act full of optionality - You can choose a book and then not read it if you don\'t want\n  - "The trick is to be bored with a specific book, not with the act of reading"\n  - Taleb would read for 30-60 hours a week!\n  - When you are bored, swap books - Do not stop reading though\n\n## The Non-Linear and the Non-Linear\n- All about how to detect antifragility\n- Shocking something antifragile is beneficial, but depends on intensity\n  - Fragile beings are harmed more by one large shock than many small ones\n  - Antifragile beings benefit more from one large shock than many small ones\n- Eating protein in a volatile manner (None on Monday and double on Wednesday) is better for you according to some studies - Find these studies\n- Do not cross a river if it is on average 4 feet deep - If you are antifragile the average means very little to you\n- Convexity - Average of f(x) is geater than f(average x)\n- Optionality means you can be wrong a lot - Your payoffs are larger than the costs\n\n## Via Negativa\n- Going the way of what is wrong, not what is right\n- Knowledge is subtractive, not additive (Grows by removing what is incorrect)\n- Being wrong is an antifragile state, because you have the option to find out that you are right\n- Do you have more than one reason for something? You might be convincing yourself to do it\n- Lindy Effect:  The old is predicted to outlast the young by proportion of their age\n  - Reading the classic books will give you a far more lasting education then new big thing on the shelves now\n- Classical texts last much longer - Antifragile knowledge\n- Fragility on a small scale gives you antifragility on a large scale\n  - Vaccinations\n  - Evolution\n- Taking the via negativa can mean getting rid of things you have - Less posessions = Happier\n\n## The Ethics of Fragility and Antifragility\n- Talking is a free option\n- If you want to know what someone thinks, look in their portfolio\n- Actions are larger than words\n- Practice what you preach and you have nailed this chapter\n- "The best way of checking whether you are alive is to see if you like variations"'}]},68:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n(105)},73:function(e,t,n){},74:function(e,t,n){},75:function(e,t,n){},76:function(e,t,n){}},[[68,1,2]]]);
