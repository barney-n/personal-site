Think for a second about your own life, what do you organise? Your clothes? Books? Passwords? Emails? Chances are you implicitly follow something similar to the system I will talk about below, and if not then this should help you get a better idea of whether its worth doing so.\n\nOne note before I dive in, I will use "organise" and "sort" interchangebly in the rest of this essay. I am aware they are not the same at the fundamental level but the concept I\'m getting acrossis the same with either action.\n\n## When should we organise?\n\nThis is essentially the same question as why should we organise, and the answer is straightforward: Organise when doing so is less effort than searching through the unorganised version. I first read about this idea in Algorithms to Live By (Christian and Griffiths). In the book the authors talk about the trade-off between sorting and searching and explain, as I have done, that it is only worth organising your "stuff" if it takes a long time to search through all that stuff relative to the amount of time it would take to sort. The authors don\'t give an explicit law to follow unlike in other chapters (my favourite remains the solution to finding a partner being 1/e), however the idea is still legitimate. When the cost of searching exceeds the cost of sorting, we should sort (and vise versa).\n\nConsider two situations: Firstly, when we can quickly sort something to make it much faster so search through, we should. Take your laundry for example. After washing your clothes, drying them, and taking them out of the drier, the cost to you of organising them then and there is much less than the cost of searching for the item you need when the time comes. On the other hand, when it takes a long time to sort something which is pretty easy to search even when unsorted, we shouldnt. In this case take your email inbox, there could be thousands of emails in there, but so long as you remember something about it such as who it was from or what was in the subject, then its not really worth spending the time to put each message into its respective folder.\n\n## How should we organise?\n\nUnorganised data is well represented by an Array. An Array is an ordered list of items (integers, strings, phone numbers, etc), and in some more modern programming languages such as Python they are called Lists. Arrays have an order but no separated organisation, and hence do well to represent the cost of disorganisation as follows: In order to check if an item is in the array you have no good strategy. Your best bet is just to check each item in any order that takes your fancy. This means that searching an Array twice as long will on average take you twice as long, the search algorithm is O(n).\n\nHowever, if we organise our data, then we can vastly improve this search efficiency. In Computer Science, one way to represent organisation that I have recently found interesting is through HashSets. A HashSet is an array of "buckets" which uses a hash function to decide which bucket each item goes into (a bucket in turn being an array). The hash function takes an item as the input, runs some operation on it and produces a hashcode, a number that correlates to a bucket in the HashSet. For example, a hash function might take the string "Dog", calculate the length as 3 and hence put the string in the 3rd bucket. The benefit of the hash function is that it can be run on items that we are searching for too. If we want to find "Dog" we know that we only need to look in the 3rd bucket, if its not there then its not in the HashSet. Intuitively this is no different to organising your clothes, where you have a hash function that takes inputs like t-shirts, shorts, socks and outputs locations like wardrobe, top drawer and bottom drawer (or perhaps floor, floor and floor in some cases).\n\nThis improvement in search efficiency allows for us to find items with an complexity closer to O(1), compared to O(n) previously, depending on the average number of items per bucket (known as the load factor).\n\nPut simply, you can find things faster if you know where you always put them.\n'},{id:"monty-hall",title:"Monty Hall",author:"No author given",date:"2020-09-05",content:"\nI remember coming across a quote somewhere that went like this: \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain something to a computer you don\u2019t understand it well enough\u201d. I\u2019ve since been looking for an interesting use case for this and have found one to satisfy my little wants in a problem called the Monty Hall problem, whose solution can often be tricky to comprehend (like it was for me). I won\u2019t bore you with an explanation of the problem however, I\u2019ll let Kevin Spacey do it for me [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5nCtgcL4jU).\n\nSimply put, you choose a door out of the three available. A duff door is then opened, leaving you with two doors left, and you are asked if you want to swap your choice of door. The answer? Always.\n\nNow when I first saw this problem, I don\u2019t think I was alone in thinking that swapping doesn\u2019t matter because each door has a 1 in 3 chance of containing the prize. However, in this case first glances are deceiving. So in an effort to better understand the rationale behind swapping doors I explained the problem to my computer.\n\nI wrote a program to simulate the Monty Hall problem 10,000 times, calculating the win probabilities of both switching and not switching. Running this code will tell you that the probability of getting a car if you change is 0.67, while if you don\u2019t change its 0.33. As Mr Spacey tells us, you do in fact double your chances of getting a new car by switching.\n\nTrust in Kevin.\n\nHave a go yourself and run the [simulation program](https://github.com/barneynapier/monty-hall/blob/main/simulation.py) on my Github\n"},{id:"stoicism",title:"Stoicism",author:"No author given",date:"2020-08-08",content:"\n## A Brief History\n\nBefore diving into what Stoicism teaches, let's summarise where it came from. The Stoics were a group of Greek philosophers living around 300 BC, who practised one of the Hellenistic philosophies called Stoicism (another you might have heard of is Epicureanism). Being a Hellenistic philosophy essentially means it was borne out of the Hellenistic period of history in Greece, which was characterised by the dominant spread of Greek culture and philosophical thought across Europe, Africa and Asia. I\u2019m going to refrain from going into too much detail about the individuals behind Stoicism, instead focusing on the ideas. However, there are three that are certainly worth mentioning: Firstly, Marcus Aurelius. Called the \u201cphilosopher king\u201d, he was a Roman emperor in the 2nd century AD and known as one of the five great rulers. Secondly there is Lucius Seneca, also known as Seneca the Younger. He was a statesman and adviser who also tutored the famous Nero before he became emperor. Finally, Epictetus. Born as a slave but eventually freed, he used his time to study and preach Stoic philosophy, focussing on practical implementation as opposed to theoretical study. Each of these men has at least one fantastic book worth reading, which I\u2019ll elaborate on toward the end.\n\n## All About Control\n\nNow we know a little about who the Stoic were, let's dive into what they taught.\n\nStoicism looks at the world as follows: There are some things that are within our control, and others that are outside of it. Of the things that are within our control, we can view them as either good, bad or neither good nor bad. Consequently in our opinions and preferences, we should desire what is good, be averse to what is bad, and be indifferent to that which is neither good nor bad. On the other hand there are the things that are not within our control. These things can be neither good nor bad, hence we should be indifferent to anything that happens that is outside our control. Instead, being grateful by desiring whatever outcome occurs. The stoics use the phrase \u201camor fati\u201d (meaning \u201cto love your fate\u201d) to represent this concept.\n\nSo the instruction is to take action to change the things that you can change so that you achieve more of the good and less of the bad. Meanwhile, be grateful for whatever comes your way if you cannot control it by wanting what you have instead of having what you want.\n\n## The Good, the Bad and the Indifferent\n\nSo that sounds great, but what is the good and what is the bad? What should we desire and what should we avoid? The Stoics had some ideas on that too. Simply put, to achieve the good, an individual must act in accordance with nature. This means performing the role that they should be performing in their current time, place and life. They proposed that a person has many roles at any given time, ranging from the most fundamental to the most specific. The most fundamental role for anyone is that of a human being. The Stoics taught that we are all rational entities, and so in order to act in accordance with nature, we should both think and act in a purely rational manner. Beyond this, we should perform the more specific roles in our life, the meaning of which is best explained via an example. Suppose you are driving your family to the beach for a weekend away (and for simplicity assume I am talking about a man here). What are your roles then? First is the role of human being, requiring you to act and think rationally. Secondly, you are a father, whose role is to educate, love and care for his children. Thirdly you are a husband, and hence should love, respect and support your wife. Beyond this you are also a car driver, whose role is to get everyone in the car to the correct destination (the beach) in a safe and prompt fashion. Now, if you were to successfully do all of these things then you would be acting and thinking in accordance with nature, and this is what the Stoics would define as achieving the good.\n\nThe other side of the coin is the bad. This is largely the opposite of the good as you would expect, meaning any action or thought that is not in accordance with nature. In addition to this, avoidance of the bad involves the avoidance of things such as overindulgence, voluptuary, laziness, dishonour, lack of self control and disloyalty. Hence, to avoid the bad one must act and think in accordance with nature, while simultaneously avoiding instances and temptations of that which is inherently bad.\n\nFinally, many philosophers have concerned themselves with the characteristics of the good, including the famous Aristotle (have a read of Ethics if you are interested in his thoughts). Over time this has lead to an entire branch of philosophical thought on the subject, which in itself could be seamlessly integrated into the Stoic approach.\n\n## Stoicism in the Modern Day\n\nStoicism is clearly an ancient philosophy, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have needed to provide the little history lesson at the beginning. However, in the last few years the philosophy has grown in modern popularity as a result of modern authors publishing more accessible and readable interpretations than the originals. Take for example Ryan Holiday. I\u2019m going to confess I haven\u2019t read any of his books, but despite this I can clearly see how he has taken these ancient concepts and marketed them to those looking for more meaning or happiness in their lives today. Sadly I can\u2019t yet come to my own conclusion of how close his ideas are to those of the original texts, but if I ever read one of his books, I\u2019ll be sure to update this section to account for it.\n\nSecondly, the concepts of Stoicism that relate to control are some of the earliest observations of a concept that many people know more commonly as that of the locus of control. The idea is that those who focus on what is in their control, and believe that what happens to them is a result of their own actions tend to be more motivated, disciplined and happy in life than those who feel like everything in the world just happens to them. Sounds familiar right? Once again the ancient idea from the Stoics appears to have been re-marketed to fit the modern day world (although I have no evidence that the locus of control theory originated from Stoicism).\n\nFinally, the area of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is a branch of psychology that focusses on changing physical reactions to situations in the body by changing the thought processes underlying them. I first noticed this link when, during a session of my own, my therapist recommended that I read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (the Stoic emperor I mentioned during the history lesson). Since then I have noticed many parallels between the two areas, mostly to do with focussing on what is within your control, being grateful for that which is not, and acting in accordance with a set of values that you fully believe in.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nNow let's wrap up. The Stoicism elevator pitch is this: When something is within your control, where you can, act in accordance with your current role well and take action to move yourself toward what is good, meanwhile if something is outside of your control, hold no hopes on the outcome and simply be grateful for what occurs.\n\nIf this sounds like something you\u2019re interested in then there is a limit to how much more I can tell you about it, and as with almost anything, learning the original foundations of the topic will serve you best. Consequently I believe it\u2019s almost always the best move to read the original texts and form your own opinions before you read a modern interpretation of them. Because of this, I would recommend you start off with what I\u2019m going to call the \u201cbig three\u201d: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, Letters from a Stoic by Seneca, and the Discourses and Handbook of Epictetus. These are the three books that I read before writing this, and they offer quite different views of the philosophy given the different backgrounds of each individual.\n"},{id:"accountability",title:"Accountability",author:"No author given",date:"2020-08-02",content:"\nAccountability is a subtle but highly effective motivator. It thrives on the social nature of human beings, using our desire for approval to ensure we get tasks done. At its core accountability is about knowing you are responsible for something, be it the health of your child, the profit of your business or the content on your website. The accountability effect is an observation based on this, namely, that we are more motivated and diligent in our actions and thoughts when we know we are accountable for them. My personal thoughts on the reason for the effectiveness of the accountability effect are that it makes us feel important, and this sense of importance (or the fear of losing it) can ensure that we complete tasks we are accountable for.\n\nBefore I go any further it is worth mentioning, despite dealing with the same topic, my discussion of the accountability effect is not based on the book by the same name. The opinions below are my own on the subject, and I have neither read the book nor know what it says about accountability. With that, onto the rest.\n\n## Transferring Accountability\n\nRichard Feynman has a great quote that goes like this: \u201cThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool\u201d. Now he meant this largely in relation to the solving of scientific problems, but I think it applies in a wider sense to any opinion we have or action we plan to take. We can all admit at some point to rationalising an action we have taken when we knew at the time it wasn\u2019t right. Common examples of this are \u201cI\u2019ll do a longer workout so I can have the cake\u201d and \u201cI shouldn\u2019t really start studying yet anyway, there\u2019s loads of time\u201d. These arguments work at the time, because we alone are inclined to believe them. However, they don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny when posed to any external counterparty.\n\nBuilding on this, there appear to me to be two main types of accountability, defined by whom we are accountable to. In the first type we are accountable to ourselves (let\u2019s call this \u201cinternal accountability\u201d), and in the second we are accountable to others (\u201cexternal accountability\u201d). In my experience, as well as what I have been reading, external accountability tends to be the stronger of the two, and so we can improve our effectiveness at certain tasks my transferring accountability from ourselves (internal) to somebody else (external). Put simply, this means taking tasks, actions, thoughts and anything else that you have been monitoring yourself and finding someone who you trust that you can make yourself accountable to.\n\nBear this in mind as we look at some examples.\n\n## Examples of Accountability Transfer\n\n### Starting a Blog\n\nIntellectual accountability (relating to your thoughts and opinions) is just as important as physical accountability (relating to your actions). Telling yourself you will learn a new topic or read around a certain area in order to know more about it is great, and personally I find learning new things one of the most satisfying things you can do. However, when left accountable to only ourselves, it can be hard to actually do anything about it, leaving our opinions weak and unstructured, having never had to fight their corner. There are many ways that you can solve this, go to a book club, talk to friends who are also interested in the same things, but one that is all the more common nowadays is to start a blog. This essentially involves airing your views, opinions and thoughts to anyone who happens to come across your site. That was my thinking when I started this blog, both to hold my opinions up to more global scrutiny, and to learn new concepts by explaining them. So, assuming at least one person reads my blog, I have successfully transferred accountability for my thoughts to them, and if nobody does, then fuck it - the world is flat and scientology is cool.\n\n### Dinner party\n\nSecondly, let\u2019s consider transferring accountability for your actions. Suppose you are interested in eating healthier but are struggling with doing so. You have two choices for what to do on Friday night; in the first you tell yourself you are going to cook a healthy meal, holding yourself personally accountable for doing so. In the second you invite your friends around, explicitly telling them that you\u2019re going to cook something containing avocados, vegetables and whatever quinoa is. Now, in which scenario are you more likely to end up cooking that meal? The answer for most people will be the dinner party, as your dinner guests will hold you accountable should they not enjoy a healthy meal on Friday.\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, this is a topic that has been researched by those much more intelligent than me, oftentimes under different names. For example, Robert Cialdini talks about something in his book Influence (highly recommended) called \u201cconsistency\u201d. This principle states that once people act in a certain way, they feel that other people expect them to continue acting in that way, imploring them to continue doing so in order to appear consistent. Practically speaking, Cialdini is (indirectly) saying that by acting in a certain way you are transferring some accountability for those actions to those around you. This is the same concept however, showing that we can use the transfer of accountability from ourselves to others to improve our motivation and diligence.\n\nGet in touch if you have any thoughts on the above.\n"}]},34:function(e){e.exports=[{id:"7-brief-lessons-on-physics",title:"7 Brief Lessons on Physics",author:"Carlo Rovelli",date:"yyyy-mm-dd",stars:"4",isbn:"9780399184437",content:"\n### Most beautiful Theory\n- Einstein discovered that the gravitational field IS the space Newton talked about\n- Cosmic background radiation from the big bang (explosion of a small overheated universe that made our large ever expanding one) is proof of the big bang\n \n### Quanta\n- The idea of light as photons (packets of energy)\n- Werner Heisenberg devised the idea that electrons only exist when being interacted with, and that when not so, they are simply a calculable probability, this helped with the quantum leap theory/idea\n- Quantum mechanics is using the idea that no object has a definite position unless colliding with something else\n- To this day we cannot prove why this theory holds, we just accept that reality only occurs in interesting\n \n### Architecture of the Cosmos\n- Corpernicus proved the earth wasn't the centre of everything \n- The universe began as a small ball and exploded into its current cosmic dimensions\n- There are billions of planets out there just like Earth, as our galaxy is one of billions\n- A grain of sand on a beach has more significance than our galaxy in the universe\n \n### Particles\n- Quarks are glued together by gluons to make protons and neutrons\n- Electrons quarks photons and gluons are the elementary particles that make up everything around us, they fluctuate between existence and non existence according to quantum theory\n- \"Standard model of elementary particles\"\n- There is a large cloud of dark matter surrounding every galaxy\n- Dark matter is just something we know is there but don't know what it is, and the standard model doesn't explain it\n \n### Loop Quantum Gravity Theory\n- Quantum mechanics and general relativity conflict each other but are both such good theories \n- Loop quantum gravity theory says that space is made up of minute particles (atoms of space) that link together to give the texture of space\n- The atoms of space are not in space because they are space\n- This theory does not include time, everything moves on its own time scale and there is no universal passing of time\n- A black hole is a rebounding Planck star that is expanding in extreme slow motion, if you were on the star of would seem fast as the lack of gravity speeds up time\n- This theory says that the big bang was actually a bounce outward following a previous universe collapsing in on itself like a black hole for universes\n \n### Probability, Time and The Heat of Black Holes\n- Heat is atoms vibrating more quickly \n- Heat proves that time exists, without friction (heat transfer) a pendulum would fluctuate forever and if you played it in reverse would seem the same, but with friction you can tell the future (small fluctuations) from the past (larger fluctuations)\n- Boltzmann discovered that heat moves from hot to cold due to probability.

After leaving school and being in and out of university, he set off on a mission to circumnavigate the world, chasing the globes best waves with a friend of his, Bryan. After about 2 years of doing exactly that, he settled down in South Africa for a while to teach at a school and surf some of the local waves. Eventually he moved back home to California where he tells stories of the undergroud surfing scene there that most are unaware of. The book finishes up with him in New York, writing full time as a journalist and often running off to New York's (much colder) waves.\n\nThroughout the book a few things stick out.\n\n**A \"way of life\"**: The love of surfing has been a rare constant throughout his life. Over 40 years since starting, he will still drop what he is doing at a moment's notice and run off with a wetsuit to catch a wave in the freezing cold seas of New York. It really makes you want to find your own passion, whatever your own version of surfing is. \n\n**Risking it all for a wave**: Along a similar vein, the risks of injury that himself and his friends often took is impressive. A lifelong passion yes. But never anything more than the next wave. Surfers dont look at the sport as a whole very often. Instead they think \"is it worth it for this wave?\". The answer is almost always yes.\n\n**Surfing friendships**: Finnegan made new friends through surfing from the age of 14 all the way through to 40. Never short of a kind person to share the sport with.\n\n**Growth through travel**: By meeting new people and seeing new cultures, he clearly developed a new way of looking at the world. A more complete one. In moving to Hawaii with his family he had left western culture. And travelling in his 20s simply continued to widen his perspective. \n\n**Always writing**: This may not surprise many people, but as a budding writer and journalist he was always writing. Journals for his personal use. Articles for travel and surf magazines. A novel of his own. This shouldn't surprise that many, but it's worth noting that, as usual, the best way to do what you want to do professionally is to do a shit-load of it non-professionally first. There's rarely a short cut. \n\n\n"},{id:"the-proud-highway",title:"The Proud Highway",author:"Hunter S Thompson",date:"2023-04-11",stars:"5",isbn:"9781408822937",content:'I really enjoyed this. Thompson is a breath of fresh air and this comes through nowhere more clearly than in his letters. It\'s rare that the history of someones writing is documented so well from the early years of their life (this book starts with letters he wrote at 17, and ends in his 30s).\n\nIt\'s certainly not the perfect example of how to live. He continued to make the same mistakes many times, and made a lot of decisions that happened to work out for him but probably wouldn\'t in most cases. \n\nThat being said, it is certainly a lesson in living. You can\'t help but be inspired to do something more outrageous and different in your life as a result of reading the views of this man. \n\nFavourite quotes below:\n\n# Work\n- "Gonzo, he wrote, \u201cis a style of \u2018reporting based on William Faulkner\u2019s idea that the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism"\n- "Also, without the slightest exaggeration, I drink approximately 20 cups of coffee every 24 hours and manage to sleep about 5 hours a night."\n- "Instead of battling my environment, I enjoy my work tremendously and put in about 15 hours a day at it\u2014for the simple reason that I like to write."\n- "I just keep wandering around, doing all these things and not worrying about what the results will be.

A. Book. I've always struggled with recommending people books. Thats why I share what I myself have read instead of telling others what to read. But this book has made that question so easy to answer. It is my number one go to book to reccomend to people. It's empowering in it's idea of individuality, and motivates you to follow your own way in life as opposed to conforming into something that deep down you know you are not. \n\nHoward Roark is the main character, and exemplifies all the ideas that Rand is writing about perfectly. He would undoubtedly be the most independent person you have ever met, if you were so lucky. \n\nThe essential essence of the book is around moving society forward through individuals making completely self interested decisions about the way they think the world should be. In this case it is Roark and his modernist style of architecture. It mocks what Rand calls the 'second handers' that simply mirror the opinions of others and follow the crowd. \n\nDont be a second hander.\n\n## Highlights\n\n\"It's for four years. But, on the other hand, Guy Francon offered me a job with him some time ago. Today he said it's still open. And I don't know which to take.\" Roark looked at him; Roark's fingers moved in slow rotation, beating\nagainst the steps. \"If you want my advice, Peter,\" he said at last, \"you've made a mistake already. By asking me. By asking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work. Don't you know what you want? How can you stand it, not to know?\" \"You see, that's what I admire about you, Howard. You always\nknow.\"\n\"Drop the compliments.\"\n\"But I mean it. How do you always manage to decide?\" \"How can you let others decide for you?\"\n\"But you see, I'm not sure, Howard. I'm never sure of myself. I don't know whether I'm as good as they all tell me I am. I wouldn't admit that to anyone but you. I think it's because you're always so sure that\nI...\" \"Petey!\" Mrs. Keating's voice exploded behind them. \"Petey, sweet- heart! What are you doing there?\"\nShe stood in the doorway, in her best dress of burgundy taffeta, happy\nand angry.\n\"And here I've been sitting all alone, waiting for you! What on earth are you doing on those filthy steps in your dress suit? Get up this minute! Come on in the house, boys. I've got hot chocolate and cookies ready for you.\"\n\"But, Mother, I wanted to speak to Howard about something impor- tant,\" said Keating. But he rose to his feet.\nShe seemed not to have heard. She walked into the house. Keating followed.\nRoark looked after them, shrugged, rose and went in also.\nMrs. Keating settled down in an armchair, her stiff skirt crackling. \"Well?\" she asked. \"What were you two discussing out there?\"\nKeating fingered an ash tray, picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then, ignoring her, turned to Roark.\n\"Look, Howard, drop the pose,\" he said, his voice high. \"Shall I junk the scholarship and go to work, or let Francon wait and grab the Beaux- Arts to impress the yokels? What do you think?\"\nSomething was gone. The one moment was lost.\n\"Now, Petey, let me get this straight...\" began Mrs. Keating. \"Oh, wait a minute, Mother! . . . Howard, I've got to weigh it care fully. It isn't everyone who can get a scholarship like that. You're pretty\n\n---\nIt was right and it was good, that house growing under his hand, because men were still worshiping the masters who had done it before him. He did not have to wonder, to fear or to take chances; it had been done for him.\n\n---\n\"You call that freedom?\"\n\"To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing.\" \"What if you found something you wanted?\"\n\"I won't find it. I won't choose to see it. It would be part of that lovely world of yours. I'd have to share it with all the rest of you-and I wouldn't. You know, I never open again any great book I've read and loved. It hurts me to think of the other eyes that have read it and of what they were. Things like that can't be shared. Not with people like that.\"\n\n---\nThere was no such person as Mrs. Wayne Wilmot; there was only a shell containing the opinions of her friends, the picture postcards she had seen, the novels of country squires she had read; \n\n---\n\"Don't you know that most people take most things because that's what's given them, and they have no opinion whatever? Do you wish to be guided by what they expect you to think they think or by your own judgment?\"\n\n---\nKeating let himself be carried by the torrent. He needed the people and the clamor around him. There were no questions and no doubts when he stood on a platform over a sea of faces; the air was heavy, compact, saturated with a single solvent-admiration; there was no room for anything else. He was great; great as the number of people who told him so. He was right; right as the number of people who believed it. He looked at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself born in them, he saw himself being granted the gift of life. That was Peter Keating, that, the reflection in those staring pupils, and his body was only its reflection.\n\n---\n\"It is so commonplace,\" she drawled, \"to be understood by every- body.\"\n\n---\nWhat is kinder-to believe the best of people and burden them with a nobility beyond their endurance or to see them as they are, and accept it because it makes them comfortable? Kindness being more important than justice, of course.\"\n\n---\n\"It's good to suffer. Don't complain. Bear, bow, accept-and be grateful that God has made you suffer. For this makes you better than the people who are laughing and happy. If you don't understand this, don't try to understand. Everything bad comes from the mind, because the mind asks too many questions. It is blessed to believe, not to under- stand. So if you didn't get passing grades, be glad of it. It means that you are better than the smart boys who think too much and too easily.\"\n\n---\nAnd as Roark looked at him, he added: \"Don't worry. They're all against me. But I have one advantage: they don't know what they want.\nI do.\"\n\n---\n\"That's true,\" whispered Keating. He would not have admitted it to anyone else.\n\"You missed the beautiful pride of utter selflessness. Only when you learn to deny your ego, completely, only when you learn to be amused by such piddling sentimentalities as your little sex urges-only then will achieve the greatness which I have always expected of you.\"\nyou \"You... you believe that about me, Ellsworth? You really do?\"\n\"I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't. But to come back to love.\n\n---\n\"Yes, if it's your chief concern. Don't you see how egotistical it is? To\nhell with everybody so long as I'm virtuous.\"\n\n---\nHe recognized nothing but the accuracy of his own judgment. \n\n---\nThere was no order in his read- ing; but there was order in what remained of it in his mind.\n\n---\nWynand showed no interest in the previous standing of his prey. He showed no interest in men of glittering success who had commercialized their careers and held no particular beliefs of any kind. His victims had a single attribute in common: their immacu- late integrity.\n\n---\nBut you have to flatter people whom you despise in order to impress other people who despise you.\"\n\n---\n\"I'd rather...\" Then he cried: \"I'd rather you'd express an opinion,\nGod damn it, just once!\" She asked, in the same level monotone: \"Whose opinion, Peter? Gor- don Prescott's? Ralston Holcombe's? Ellsworth Toohey's?\"\n\n---\n\"You're beginning to see, aren't you, Peter? Shall I make it clearer? You never wanted me to be real. You never wanted anyone to be. But you didn't want me to show it. You wanted an act to help your act-a beautiful, complicated act, all twists, trimmings and words. All words. You didn't like what I said about Vincent Knowlton. You liked it when I said the same thing under cover of virtuous sentiments. You didn't want me to believe. You only wanted me to convince you that I be- lieved. My real soul, Peter? It's real only when it's independent-you've discovered that, haven't you? It's real only when it chooses curtains and desserts you're right about that-curtains, desserts and religions, Peter, and the shapes of buildings. But you've never wanted that. You wanted a mirror. People want nothing but mirrors around them. To reflect them while they're reflecting too. You know, like the senseless infinity you get from two mirrors facing each other across a narrow passage. Usually in the more vulgar kind of hotels. Reflections of reflec- tions and echoes of echoes. No beginning and no end. No center and no purpose. I gave you what you wanted. I became what you are, what your friends are, what most of humanity is so busy being-only without the trimmings. I didn't go around spouting book reviews to hide my emptiness of judgment-I said I had no judgment. I didn't borrow de- signs to hide my creative impotence-I created nothing. I didn't say that equality is a noble conception and unity the chief goal of mankind-I just agreed with everybody. You call it death, Peter? That kind of death-I've imposed it on you and on everyone around us. But you- you haven't done that. People are comfortable with you, they like you, they enjoy your presence. You've spared them the blank death. Because you've imposed it-on yourself.\"\nHe said nothing. She walked away from him, and sat down again, waiting.\n\n---\nEvery building is like a person. Single and unrepeat- able.\"\n\n---\n\"It is a masterpiece,\" said Jules Fougler. \"I hope you will prove yourself worthy of it, Peter. It is the kind of play that depends upon what the members of the audience are capable of bringing with them into the theater. If you are one of those literal-minded people, with a dry soul and a limited imagination, it is not for you. But if you are a real human being with a big, big heart full of laughter, who has preserved the uncorrupted capacity of his childhood for pure emotion-you will find it an unforgettable experience.\"\n\n---\nMany stole Cameron's forms; few understood his thinking. \n\n---\nI would stand and say: I am Gail Wynand, the man who has committed every crime except the foremost one: that of ascribing futility to the wonderful fact of existence and seeking justification beyond myself. This is my pride: that now, thinking of the end, I do not cry like all the men of my age: but what was the use and the meaning? I was the use and the meaning, I, Gail Wynand. That I lived and that I acted.\n\n---\n\"Howard, I'm a parasite. I've been a parasite all my life. You de- signed my best projects at Stanton. You designed the first house I ever built. You designed the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. I have fed on you and on all the men like you who lived before we were born. The men who designed the Parthenon, the Gothic cathedrals, the first skyscrapers. If they hadn't existed, I wouldn't have known how to put stone on stone. In the whole of my life, I haven't added a new doorknob to what men have done before me. I have taken that which was not mine and given nothing in return. I had nothing to give. This is not an act, Howard, and I'm very conscious of what I'm saying. And I came here to ask you to save me again. If you wish to throw me out, do it now.\"\n\n---\n\"Howard - anything you ask. Anything. I'd sell my soul ...\"\n\"That's the sort of thing I want you to understand. To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That's what everybody does every hour of his life. If I asked you to keep your soul - would you understand why that is much harder?\"\n\n---\nBoth are only the means of my work. Peter, before you can do things for people, you must be the kind of man who can get things done. But to get things done, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences. The work, not the people. Your own action, not any possible object of your charity. I'll be glad if people who need it find a better manner of living in a house I designed. But that's not the motive of my work. Nor my reason. Nor my reward.\"\n\n---\nThe only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself. My work done my way. \n\n---\n\"You'll get everything society can give a man. You'll keep all the\nmoney. You'll take any fame or honor anyone might want to grant. You'll accept such gratitude as the tenants might feel. And I-I'll take what nobody can give a man, except himself. I will have built Cort- landt.\"\n\n---\nI never think of myself in relation to anyone else. \n\n---\n\"I've looked at him-at what's left of him-and it's helped me to\nunderstand. He's paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he's been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness-in other people's eyes. Fame, admiration, envy-all that which comes from others. Oth- ers dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn't want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn't want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There's your actual selflessness. It's his ego that he's betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.\"\n\n---\n\"Aren't they all acting on a selfish motive - to be noticed, liked, admired?\"\n\n\"- by others. At the price of their own self respect. In the realm of great important - the realm of values, of judgement, of spirit, of thought - they place others abve self, in the exact manner which altruism demands. A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesnt need it\"\n\n...\n\n\"That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They're concerned only with people. They dont ask 'Is this true?' They ask 'Is this what others think is true?' Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. What would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists. You dont think through anothers brain and you dont work through anothers hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent judgement, you suspent consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation. Anchored to nothing\"\n\n---\nIf any man stopped and asked himself whether he's ever held a truly personal desire, he'd find the answer. He'd see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other men. He's not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion-prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can't say about a single thing: 'This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.' Then he wonders why he's unhappy. Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to be touched. \n\n---\nA self-sufficient ego.\n\n---\n\"We have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to recognize it,\" said another Wynand editorial. \"We have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that greatness is to be gauged by self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate virtue. Let's stop and think for a moment. Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convic- tions? The honesty of his feeling? The independence of his thought? But these are a man's supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. They, however, are above sacrificing to any cause or consideration whatsoever. Should we not, then, stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense? Self-sacrifice? But it is pre- cisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed. It is the unsacri- ficed self that we must respect in man above all.\"\n\n---\nToohey - \"The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. A world where the thought of each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought in the brain of his neigh- bor who'll have no thought of his own but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor who'll have no thought-and so on, Peter, around the globe. Since all must agree with all. A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who'll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who'll have no desires-around the globe, Peter. Since all must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that headless monster-prestige. \"\n\n---\n\nEvery single thing I told you? Isn't Europe swallowed already and we're stumbling on to follow? Everything I said is contained in a single word collectivism. And isn't that the god of our century? To act together. To think- together. To feel-together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. Divide and conquer-first. But then-unite and rule.\n\n---\nAnything may be betrayed, anyone may be forgiven. But not those who lack the courage of their own greatness. Alvah Scarret can be forgiven. He had nothing to betray. Mitchell Layton can be forgiven. But not I. I was not born to be a second-hander.\n\n---\nThe misery of knowing how strong and able one is in one's own mind, the radiant picture never to be made real. Dreams? Self-delusion? Or a murdered reality, unborn, killed by that corroding emotion without name - fear - need - dependence - hatred?\n\n---\n\"Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received-hatred. The great creators-the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors- stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. \n\n---\n\"And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement.\n\"Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. Animals obtain food by force. Man has no claws, no fangs, no horns, no great strength of muscle. He must plant his food or hunt it. To plant, he needs a process of thought. To hunt, he needs weapons, and to make weapons-a process of thought. From this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstrac- tion, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man-the function of his reasoning mind.\n\"But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary conse- quence. The primary act-the process of reason-must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred.\n\n---\nAnd here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways-by the independent work of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of others. \n\n---\n\n\"Degrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree of a man's independence, initiative and personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker and his worth as a man. Inde- pendence is the only gauge of human virtue and value. What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or hasn't done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity. There is no standard of personal dignity except independence.\n\n...\n\n\"The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, pro- vided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty, his thinking, his work.

It talks about how they occur at the intersection of randomness and uniformity, making them definitively different from a random process. Gell-Mann goes on to explain how complex adaptive systems perform best at this intersection of uncertainty and regularity, and then gives some examples of these systems in the real world. \n\nThe second section goes into fundamental Physics, which is a subject in which Gell-Mann won a nobel prize. This section is a lot like a primer of particle physics as it relates to the other topics Gell-Mann mentions. If you\'re after a more complete primer of Physics as a discipline, I\'d recommend [The Character of Physical Law](https://barneynapier.github.io/#/book/the-character-of-physical-law) by Feynman. It has a lot in common with this section. \n\nGell-Mann finishes off by bringing the first two sections together to see how complex adaptive systems perform in the real world. The focus is on Darwinian evolution, but he goes into more modern day applications of the same idea too. For example genetic machine learning algorithms (which at the time of publication must have been right at the forefront of statistical modelling).\n\n## Complex Adaptive Systems\n\n### Complex adaptive system (p25)\n1. Acuire information about environment\n2. Identify regularities\n3. Construct schema (model of the environment)\n4. Act based on that schema\n5. Reselect based on consequences (competition among schema)\n\n### Complexity\n- **Coarse graining**\n    - You need to specify a level of detail when describing a system\n    - When you do not go as detailed as possible you are using "coarse graining"\n    - Eg. Coarse grain from particles to atoms, atoms to objects\n- Context dependence - Any definition of complexity will be context dependent\n- Definitions of complexity\n    - Crude complexity = Length of shortest message that will describe a system\n    - **Algorithmic information content (AIC)** = Length of a computer program that will print out the system description then halt\n    - Compressability = How much you can compress a string of bits (eg 1010101010 is just 10 done 5 times)\n\n### Randomness\n- Definitions\n    1. No rule to compress its description\n    2. Generated by a random process\n    3. Generated by a mathematical formula so complex it is basically random ("pseudo-random")\n\n### Complexity != Randomness\n- Consider a string of random integers - Very random, not complex at all\n- **Complexity comes from a balance of randomness and non-randomness**\n- Current definitions only really measure randomness\n- The difference between randomness and complexity requires "Effective complexity"\n- **Effective complexity** = Len(schema) used by a CAS in the system\n    - Highest at the intersection of randomness and non-randomness\n    - EC plotted vs AIC looks like a pyramid\n    - AIC ~ regular + irregular\n    - EC ~ regular * irregular\n\n### Example CAS\n- **Child learning a language**\n    - Schema = Grammar\n    - So in this case, effective complexity would be the length of the grammar textbook (makes sense)\n- **Bacteria developing drug resistance**\n    - Schema = Genotype\n    - The CAS is the whole population of bacteria, not just one\n    - Genotype = regular / mutation = random\n    - Direct adaption = Chemically changing in reaction to a drug as opposed to by evolutionary survival\n- **The human scientific enterprise**\n    - Schema = Theory\n    - Optimisation of theory = Minimise complexity of schema subject to agreeing with observation\n    - Theories should be falsifiable (Karl Popper)\n    - Unifying theories greatly compress ideas from multiple fields into one set of equations (eg. General relativity, electromagnetism)\n\n### Theory\n- **Power law** distributions\n    - **Scale independent** (can multiply all ranks by a factor and nothing changes)\n    - "Self organised criticality" - Piles of sand example\n- Depth =~ Time to decompress a schema into the full description\n- Crypticity =~ Time for a computer to find the program that compresses the description into a schema\n\n### Fundamentals\n- Levels of science: Maths -> Physics -> Chemistry -> Biology -> Social Science\n- **A** is more fundamental than **B** if:\n    1. Laws of A can explain phenomena of B\n    2. Laws of A are more general than that of B\n- Eg. Quantum Electrodynamics is more fundamental than chemistry\n- **Reductionism** = Explaining the less fundamental in terms of the more fundamental\n- Lowest level not always best: You cannot understand psychology by knowing the chemistry of the brain\n\n## Fundamental Physics\n*Any fundamental force must be associated with an elementary particle that is the quantum of the corresponding field*\n\n### The Quantum Approach\n- Classical physics is only an approximation\n- Quantum state = Description of the probability distribution of position and momentum of all particles in the universe\n- Quantum Mechanics =~ Gravitational fields + electromagnetic fields + conservation of main quantities (energy, charge, ..)\n- Alternative histories / **decoherence**\n    - Traditional probabilities (between 0 and 1) require history to be sufficiently coarse grained\n    - Alternative histories are actually entangled when there is not enough interference \n    - D = decoherence functional\n    - Coarse graining allows histories to decohere into independent probailities as the quantum entanglement/interference nets out among the particles\n    - This is why the single electron slit experiment can be in 2 places at once, there is no decoherence to stop it. In this situation probabilities break down\n\n### Quarks & the Standard Model\n- Quantum Field Theory\n    - Quantum Electrodynamics = Transmission of photons between electrons\n    - Quantum Chromodynamics (strong nuclear force) = Transmission of gluons between quarks\n    - (?) Weak force = Electrons turning into electron neutrinos upon transmission of a charged quanta with a quark\n- Quarks\n    - Held together by QCD\n    - Charge: up (+2/3), down (-1/3)\n    - Color: One each from red, green and blue\n        - Driver of the strong force\n        - Gluons concerned with color - red-blue, blue-green, green-red gluons\n- Fermion families\n    1. Electron & neutrino, up & down quarks\n    2. Muon & neutrino, charmed (+2/3) & strange (-1/3) quarks\n    3. Tauon & neutrino, top (+2/3) and bottom (-1/3) quarks\n- Symmetry\n    - Time\n    - Matter/antimatter\n    - Spin (elementary fermions have spin 1/2, quanta have spin 1). Higgs boson only 0 spin particle\n\n### Arrows of time\n1. **Radiative arrow**: Energy radiates outward as time passes, never inward\n2. **Records arrow**: The creation of memories, and organisation of information\n3. **Cosmological arrow**: vThe universe is expanding\n4. **Thermodynamic arrow**\n    - 2nd Law of Thermodynamics = Entropc of a closed system does not decrease\n    - Over time systems tend toward disorder (Entropy)\n    - Because disorder is so probable\n    - The initial condition of the universe was the most organised\n    - Maxwells demon\n        - Organising hot/cold particles across a divide\n        - The demon himself must gain Entropy if the rest of the system loses it\n        - Comes from "shredding", the need to delete information in order to make space for organisation\n- Universe trending toward higher maximum complexity (potential, not effective)\n\n## Evolution & Selection\n\n### Fitness\n- Evolutionary drive toward higher complexity\n    - Diffusion from random walk of nature\n    - Amplified by gateway events\n- Markets and evolution\n    - Both CASs that adapt to inefficiencies\n    - They fill niches in the system\n- Fitness landscapes\n    - Getting to the lowest point on the fitness landscape = Stochastic Gradient Descent\n    - Inclusive fitness\n\n### Characteristics of Creative Thinking\n- Disregarding a previously held belief\n- Steps of breakthrough\n    1. **Saturation** = Work hard and intensely on a problem, filling the mind with all the difficulties\n    2. **Incubation** = Carry the problem around with you, thinking it over\n    3. **Illumination** = The eureka moment, you are doing something else then the solution comes to you\n- Escaping into a deeper basin on the fitness landscape --\x3e **Introduce randomness**\n- Creative characteristics\n    - Dedication to the task\n    - Awareness of being trapped in an unsuitable basin\n    - Degree of comfort with teetering on the edge of basins\n    - Capacity to formulate and solve problems\n\n### Superstition\n- Pattern recognition\n    - **Superstition** = Seeing a pattern in randomness\n    - **Skepticism** = Not seeing a pattern where there is one\n\n### Maladaption\n- Why do some schemata adapt to be worse/in a bad way?\n- 3 types of adaption\n    1. **Direct adaption** = Reacting to the environment, you adapt to fire by not touching it\n    2. **Changing schema** = Updating the geneaology in the case of evolution\n    3. **Death** = The exctinction of a species\n- Schema adapt to the wrong thing (looking at the wrong features)\n- External influences impact the schema adaption (often humans)\n- Schemata may be adapting, just doing so slowly\n\n### Machine Learning\n- Learning: Neural nets, genetic algorithms\n- Simulation: Evolution, ecologies, economies\n- Economics as a CAS\n    - Economics ~ Study of incentives\n    - Uses agent based mathematics (more discrete than continuous)\n    - Economic agents are CASs with schemata\n    - They have bounded rationality and imperfect information\n    - Act based on chance and economic interest'},{id:"everything-is-fucked",title:"Everything Is Fucked",author:"Mark Manson",date:"2021-09-18",stars:"4",isbn:"9780062888464",content:'\nAs humans we aim for Happiness. The opposite of happiness is not anger or sadness, its hopelessness and meaninglessness. So humans need hope and meaning. We need 3 things for this: (a) A sense of control, (b) a belief in the value of something, and (c) a community. A healthy sense of control means understanding that our feeling brain drives our actions, and instead learning to see our emotions more objectively through our thinking brain, instead of controlling them. A belief in the value of something comes from the narratives we tell ourselves about past and future experiences. And a community comes from sharing values with others and having them support our ideals. The modern world has begun to deprive us of these three things, hence why "everything is fucked". In theory people should mature from pleasure based values to transactional values to abstract values. Yet many get stuck holding transactional values because they value nothing above themselves. This can be solved through Kant\'s formula for humanity, which says we should treat all humans (including ourselves) as an end, and not merely a means. Finally, modern society has got so good at improving the pain people feel that we are now at a stage where we are eliminating it. As a result we have become addicted to comfort and pleasure, losing sight of better values in the process. \n\n## Hope\n\n### The Uncomfortable Truth\nOne day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will ever matter.\n\n### To maintain and build hope, we need 3 things\n1. A sense of control\n2. A beleif in the value of something\n3. A community\n\n### 1. A Sense of Control\n- The two brains\n\t1. Thinking brain\n\t2. Feeling brain\n- The **classic assumption** is that our thinking brain is in control of our actions\n- In reality our feelings control our actions, and our thinking brain rationalises narratives for the way we feel (and hence act)\n- "The thinking brain makes shit up that the feeling brain wants to hear"\n- Deny feeling brain --\x3e numbed to the world, struggling to form meaningful relationships\n- Deny thinking brain --\x3e impulsive and selfish\n- Self control is an illusion: Self control --\x3e Self acceptance\n- Thinking brain should simply check in on how the feeling brain is doing\n- Recognising that your feeling brain could be wrong, and acting accordingly is the key to **emotional regulation**\n- The feeling brain controls feelings and impulses, but the thinking brain controls the **meaning** of those feelings\n\n### 2. A Belief in the Value of Something\n- Newtons 3 laws of emotion\n\t1. Every action has an equal and opposite emotional reaction\n\t\t- **Moral gaps**\n\t\t\t- Difference between what happened and what is deserved\n\t\t\t- Call for **equalisation** (punishment, reaction, pain, debt)\n\t\t\t- Moral gaps require us to determine some things as better than others\n\t\t\t- Hence our value hierarchies determine the moral gaps we seek to equalise\n\t\t-"The more insecure you are about something the more you flap back and forth between delisuional feelings of superiority (I\'m the best) and delusional feelings of inferiority (I suck)"\n\t2. Our self worth equals the sum of our emotions over time\n\t\t- Our identity is emotionally created not logically created\n\t\t- Our values are stories we tell ourselves about experiences we have had in the past\n\t\t\t- Feeling brain feels something --\x3e Thinking brain constructs a narrative to explain it --\x3e We build up a network of these narratives --\x3e This becomes our identity\n\t3. Your identity will remain your identity until an external force acts against it\n\t\t\t- Hence the only way to change our values is\n\t\t\t\t1. Re-examine past experiences and re-write the narratives around them\n\t\t\t\t2. Write narratives you want to live by then go out and follow them (ie. Have experiences contrary to your current values)\n\n### 3. A Community\n> Having others around us who share our values and support our ideals\n- This was the "how to start your own religion" chapter (not the best part of the book)\n- Pain is common\n- **God value**\n\t- The value at the top of the hierarchy is the lens through which you see all other values\n\n### Nietzsche\'s Moralities\n1. **Master morality** - Beleives in virtue of strength and dominance\n2. **Slave morality**- Beleives in virtue of  sacrifice and submission\n\n## Everything is Fucked\n\n### Maturity\n- Kohlberg\'s stages of moral development\n\t1. Children: Avoid pain and pursue pleasure\n\t2. Adolescents: Transactional values, I\'ll suffer pain if you give me pleasure\n\t3. Adults: Do things because they are right, not expecting anything in return\n\n### Kant\'s Formula for Humanity\n\n> "Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means"\n\n- Things we treat as means are interacted with conditionally\n- Unconditional action comes from treating things as an end (being an adult)\n\n### Pain as the Constant\n- **Blue Dot Effect** / rule of 7\n\t- In the experiment, participants expected to see blue dots about half the time, so they projected that onto the experiment\n\t- Same happens with stress/happiness/feelings\n\t- We expect life to have a certain level of happiness and in the long term we always revert to this (rule of7)\n\t- We also amplify/dampen our emotional reactions to stress so that it meets our expectations\n- Trying to eliminate pain just backfires, we see the little things in our lives as so much bigger because theres nothing else to cause us pain (and we expect a certain amount)\n- Pain is the universal constant. It will always be there. Key is choosing the pain\n- Avoiding pain --\x3e Fragile\n- Choosing pain and accepting it --\x3e Anti-fragile\n- Pain = Value\n\t- The amount we are willing to suffer for something defines how much we value it\n\n### Marketing to Feelings\n- Edward Bernays\n\t- Edward Bernays literally invented marketing to the emotions\n\t- He started in 1920s america, marketing cigarettes to women as a symbol of protest and independence\n\t- The whole of marketing is based around:\n\t\t1. Highlight, heighten and needle at peoples shame and insecurity\n\t\t2. Tell them your product will rid them of that shame and insecurity\n- Modern western economy --\x3e Developed --\x3e Instead of choosing different pain we can afford to avoid pain --\x3e We get addicted to comfort and pleasure --\x3e Our values diminish accordingly, now we care about instagram filters and makeup as opposed to life experience and connection\n- Fake vs real freedom\n\t- Fake freedom puts us on the hedonic treadmill\n\t- Real freedom involves limitation ("what am I willing to give up"). The best things in life come from commitment\n\n'},{id:"against-the-gods",title:"Against the Gods",author:"Peter Bernstein",date:"2021-08-19",stars:"4",isbn:"0471121045",content:'\n## Pre 1200: Beginnings\n- Probability and risk was borne out of gambling\n- It begun in Greece, when their philosophers were at the forefront of intellectual discussion\n- Counting and numbers were needed before probability could be known\n- Fibonacci and his series\n- The golden ratio\n- The abacus\n- The number system was developed by hindus\n- The centrepeice of the hindu number system was the invention of the number 0\n\n## 1200 -> 1700: A Thousand Outstanding Facts\n\n### The Renaissance Man\n- **Girolamo Cardano**\n\t- Extracted the first ideas of probability from gambling\n\t- Was also a gambling addict\n\t- Did a lot of work on combinations of numbers\n- **Luca Paccioli**\n\t- Came up with the "problem of Balla", in which two players are playing a game of balla and it is cut short. \n\t- The question is, how do you divide the pot among the two players? \n\t- Evenly?

slaves **and** white servants\n- Servants not as low as slaves\n- Slave revolution was a constant threat for slave masters\n- South and north depended on slavery to different degrees\n\t- The south had plantations and hence needed slaves more\n\n## Independence from Britain (date?)\n- "Bacon\'s Rebellion"\n- Re-read with knowledge of US geography\n- UK was using the US for money (taxation etc)\n- Before this the US was all english colonies (GB basically owned america)\n- Americans fought against GB rule\n- Wanted land from both the UK and the native americans\n- "7 years war" - France vs GB for ownership of North America\n- France helped America to gain independence from GB\n\n## American Revolution (1750s -> 1800)\n- After independence from GB.

Baker makes bread in exchange for getting shoes fixed by cobbler)\n- Great depression layoffs lead to mass meetings of unemployed workers\n- Workers unions were eventually recognised as entitites (this reduced the number of strikes)\n\n## World War 2\n- President = Truman -> Eisenhower -> JFK\n- America was on the side of France and England\n- Got officially involved after **Pearl Harbour** (Japanese raid on US harbour in Hawaii)\n- American people almost unanymously in favour of getting involved in the war\n\t- Nicknamed "the peoples war"\n- August 1945: America drops atomic bombs on Hiroshima & Nagisaki.

If you\'re unsure if you want to give the whole book a read (it is a hefty tome), then start with that. \n\nThe speech summarises the idea of the whole book, namely,  using the one shot you get at life to make significant contributions to humanity. It emphasises a style of thinking more than a boilerplate approach. It uses example from various areas of his career in scientific research to hammer home the points, and some of that can get quite technical. But as Hamming mentions at the start, they are anciliary to the main idea of the book, so no need to get too bogged down in the maths if you don\'t want to. It\'s simply a way of showing how some the great minds he encountered approach problems.\n\nA final note that is important, dont try to internalise all the ideas of the book. Some will work for you, and others wont. Research and problem solving is a fundamentally personal activity, so see what resonates with you and build on that. \n\n---\n\n# Style of Thinking\n\n## Innovation\n\n### Thinking about the future\n- Questions for the future\n  - What is possible\n  - What is likely to happen\n  - What is desirable to happen\n- How will the future be different from now?\n- How will it be the same?\n- Think about the future to anticipate change (passive to active)\n\n### Thinking about new technologies\n- When you encounter a new technology, think in what new areas and ways can it be used? How will this be used in the future?\n- Always thinking of related concepts - how can this be applied elsewhere?\n- "What are the real world uses of this idea?"\n\n### Affecting change\n- If you do not occasionally doubt accepted rules, you will not be a leader\n- Sometimes things that are technologically feasible and economically desirable are prevented for political, social and legal reasons\n- Innovation in a field usually comes from an external source/individual\n\n## Independent Thought\n- "Believe nothing, no matter where it comes from, unless it agrees with your own sense of logic and common sense"\n- See a technology - have a hypothesis - think of an experiment to test the hypothesis\n- Take a lot of time to **think** - come up with opinions, theories and hypotheses\n- Think about something until "you are fairly clear what you believe and why you believe it"\n- Do your own work instead of spending all your time in lectures\n- Make time to turn ideas over in the mind\n- Do not just drift along, think of what you want to be and how to get there\n- Have theories on lots of things\n- If you look around your organisation there are many things that should not happen but do because they are customary \n- Develop the ability to quickly learn new fields\n\n## Working Diligently\n- Software chapter - Have care and diligence, think before you write code\n- Prove all of your assumptions, this way you\n  1. Don\'t make bad ones\n  2. Have a deep idea of what is going on\n  - Am I satisfied this is correct? \n- Do the proofs yourself\n- How will you convince yourself that you have not made a mistake somewhere\n- Question your assumptions: "Why do I believe whatever I believe?"\n- Working calmly gives you longevity, but the breakthroughs come after frustration and emotional struggle\n\n## Problem Solving\n\n### The problem\n- Be very clear on what the problem is\n- Complex idea --\x3e what does it look like?\n- How does this fit into the whole picture?\n- When thinking of complex systems --\x3e is it stable?\n- Think of how a system converges or diverges\n- Don\'t just think what a function is, what **class** is it from? What functions are similar to it? \n\n### Your toolbox\n- Multidisciplinary (all the sciences)\n- Awareness of cognitive biases\n- Have a broad scientific/mathematical toolbox from which to draw\n- "How can other subject areas apply here?"\n- A key skill in mathematics is abstract pattern recognition\n- The lab and the field are two very different things\n- Mathematics requires application to be useful\n- Prepare your mind for the future, do not just memorise, but truly understand things\n- Be aware of the limitations of certain measures and methods\n- Flexibility should be a part of modern systems and processes\n- Different skills matter at different levels in a field\n\n### Techniques\n- Start simple and build from there\n- Always start from the basics and build up from there\n- Back of the envelope calculations\n  - Retain information better\n  - Keep sharp the ability to model situations\n\n### Fundamentals\n- Focus on these\n- They:\n  - Have stood the test of time\n  - Can derive the rest of the field\n- If you know the fundamentals well, the fancy parts follow easily\n\n## Working with Others\n- Understands that most others don\'t think like him\n- Teamwork is a necessity when working on complex projects - know and understand that others have different views to you\n\n## Great Work\n- There is no shortage of opportunities to do great things. The more prepared you are the better\n- Take pride in your ability to do great work, it will be important when confidence is needed\n- Creating new things requires self confidence\n- We are nothing more than the sum total of our habits\n\n# Engineering\n\n- Digital revolution\n  - Continuous signals --\x3e discrete pulses\n  - Helped by transistors\n- Hardware chapter similar to Feynman computing book\n- L1 and L2 regularisation come from simplifications of n dimensional spaces. They are distance functions\n- Coding theory\n- Information theory should have been called communication theory \n- Quantum Mechanics\n  - Heisenberg\'s uncertainty principle\n- Data is rarely as accurate as you think\n- Systems engineering = high level thinking on a project/system\n  - Optimising the components of a system regularly ruins the performance of the whole system\n  - Systems approach to learning - being intelligent as opposed to just passing many individual exams\n- You get what you measure\n  - The method of measurement impacts the result you get'},{id:"deep-work",title:"Deep Work",author:"Cal Newport ",date:"2020-11-14",stars:"4",isbn:"9781455586691",content:"%%References: Technology addiction, Focus, Flow State | [Thinking Needs Focus](https://fs.blog/how-to-think/)%%\n\nIn the modern world of technology, our brains get used to shallow work. Shallow work is like being a human spreadsheet, it's easy to automate. Deep work on the other hand, is more productive and adds more value to the world. It cannot be automated and involves more creative output. Most importantly, Newport tells us that deep work is a skill you can learn. By focusing on creating rituals that promote deep work, we can focus more without working harder. \n\n\n## 3 Beneficiaries Of The Rise Of Complex Technology Systems\n1.

Investors with capital who put money into growing companies benefiting from tech (venture capitalists)\n\n## Determinants of Success in the Modern World\n1. Learn fast\n2. Produce high quality work fast\n\t- Deep work helps with the above massively\n\n> High quality output = time x focus \n\n## Deep Work Is Rare. Why? \n- Principle of least resistance, which says people do what is easiest in the moment, which is not deep work\n- \"Metric black whole\": you can't easily quantify the value of deep work, so it's easier to dismiss\n- Technopoly + internet centrism: the whole world thinks you're a dinosaur if you're not all for social media\n\n## Deep Work Leads To A Life Well Lived:\n- People prefer working hard at something to relaxing (book - \"Flow - The Psychology of Optimal Experience\")\n- Focusing on the right things is beneficial to you (book - \"wrapped\")\n- There's a philosophical wholesomeness to focussing on a trade, be it blacksmithing or programming \n\nHow to adopt deep work:\n- Work deeply (no shit)\n- Willpower depletion means simply trying to focus on deep work isn't enough, you need to **cultivate routines** that optimise you for deep work\n\n## Making Time For Deep Work\n\nWe can make time for deep work in different ways, which depend on how your lifestyle changes to include deep work. Such as:\n\n1. **Monastic** - remove all shallow work from life\n2. **Bi-modal** - allocate specific chunks of time to deep work, otherwise live life normally (generally at least 1 day chunks)\n3. **Rhythmic** - getting into a daily routine of hours not days \n4. **Journalistic** - Do deep work wherever you find the time \n\n## Getting Better At Deep Work\n\n### Cultivating Deep Work\n- Rituals: Routine that enables deep work\n- Grand gestures, eg JK Rowling moving into a hotel\n- Work with others (have time to collaborate, but still maintain deep work)\n\n### 4 Rules Of Execution\n1. Focus on the few most important things, not loads of things \n2. Focus on what you can control\n3. Keep a public \"scoreboard\"\n4. Maintain regular [accountability](https://barneynapier.github.io/#/post/accountability)\n\n### Downtime\n- Attention restoration theory & attention fatigue suggest that downtime allows you to rest to focus more later\n- When you're done with work, be done. Don't finish your day with half complete tasks, it leads to the [\"zeigarnik effect\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect)\n\n### Practise\n- Deep focus and mental ability is cultivated with repeated training\n- on the flip side, constant attention switching and giving in to distractions has a lasting negative impact on the brain (always multitasking means you can't recognise distractions and you're always distracted), you become addicted to distractions\n- Deep work requires training to 1) Be better at deep work 2) remove addiction to distractions \n\nDistractions are like unhealthy food. You don't take breaks from unhealthy food for a diet, you break from your diet to eat unhealthy food. Do the same between deep work and distractions (ie take breaks from focus for distraction by scheduling time to let distractions in)\n\n### Work Intensely\n- Theodore Roosevelt didn't study much at Harvard. But when he did, he went all-in on being focussed on it\n\n### Quit Social Media\n- Think about your high level goals\n- Does social media help with these\n- Using downtime to look at social media practises being distracted\n- Dont just think \"does this give me benefit\", but \"does this give me more benefit than it costs me\"\n\n### Day Within A Day\n- You work in the middle of the day\n- Treat your non work time as a day within a day\n\n### Remove Shallow Work\n- Basecamp and the 4 day work week\n- Do the bare minimum shallow work required, but no more\n\n### Schedule Every Minute Of Your Day\n- When on autopilot we don't track how we use our time well\n- This allows shallow work to creep into the day more than we allow\n\n### Say \"No\" Well\n- Be vague in your reason so people can't try to find a way to fit in\n- Have a limit on how much shallow work you do, and say no to all else\n\n### Limit Your Working Time\n- People often think they need longer than they do for work\n- Parkinson's law\n- Deep work benefits from a little pressure\n\n\n\n"},{id:"the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fuck",title:"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck",author:"Mark Manson",date:"2020-09-28",stars:"5",isbn:"9781760558772",content:"\nThis is a really good book that essentially says we should find values in our lives that we see as more important than our own suffering. Such that we would willingly be uncomfortable in the name of something more important. Because happiness comes through suffering for the right causes, and coming out the other side stronger. \n\nManson then outlines some ideas on what these values might look like. However, it's obviously a very personal process so Manson does well not to put too much emphasis on what you should think.\n\nFinally, he has an entire website of articles too. This book is actually made up of a lot of the articles he had written over the years, but there's a lot more great content on there that relates to this book and his others. So I'd recommend anything on his site too.\n\n## Don't Try\\*\n- The pursuit of positive emotions leads to negative emotions and acceptance of negative emotions leads to positive emotions\n- Seeking things highlights the lack of it\n- No happy person is ever trying to be happy\n- Negative emotions are natural, not bad (they should not be avoided)\n- So stop trying to be happy and just accept what is\n\n\\*Fun fact - \"Don't try\" is all thats written on Charles Bukowski's tombstone\n\n## Happiness is a Problem\n- Your life will always have problems, that is a constant\n- On Happiness comes from solving problems\n- You have to **enjoy the pain** of solving these problems\n- \"What pain do you want to sustain?\"\n- Love the process\n\n## You are not Special\n- 1960s self esteem movement --\x3e Entitled people\n- Entitled = Feel good about your positive traits (and shouldnt work for them)\n- Self worth = Feel good about your negative traits\n- Entitlement\n\t1) I'm awesome, I deserve special treatment\n\t2) I suck, I deserve special treatment\n- Your problems are **not** unique\n- Many people have had and will have the same problems (accept this and become more accepting of the problem)\n- Social media --\x3e Everything seems extraordinary --\x3e We must delete this concept by accepting that a lot of our lives will be mundane and uninteresting (and thats OK) --\x3e We will begin to appreciate the simple pleasures\n\n## The Value of Suffering\n- Our values determine our problems, as well as our definitions of success and failure\n- Therefore **values determine the cause of our suffering**\n- I feel something --\x3e why do I feel this way --\x3e why does that make me feel this way --\x3e ... --\x3e What are my values\n- \"Why does that seem true?\"\n- Good values\n\t1) Reality based\n\t2) Socially constructive\n\t3) Immediate and controllable\n\n## Responsibility\n- You are responsible != It is your fault\n\t- Fault = past tense\n\t- Responsible = Present tense\n- Taking responsibility is empowering, while taking fault merely starts a blame game regarding things that have already happened\n\n## Uncertainty\n- Doubt drives growth\n- Certainty = comfort\n- Challenge your own beleifs\n- Insecurity is bred out of a **need** for certainty\n- Most of the time you just need to **be content that you dont know** (especially about yourself)\n- Be Antifragile\n- Dont be special\n\t- Define yourself in general terms (Artist, student, trader, ...)\n\n## Failure\n- Failure --\x3e Learning --\x3e Success\n- Pain is good - Part of the process\n- **Just do something**\n\t- Fear of failure makes us do nothing\n\t- Inspiration --\x3e Motivation --\x3e Action --\x3e Inspiration --\x3e Motivation --\x3e Action --\x3e ..\n\t- The only part of this cycle that we directly control is action. So if we want to kick it off, that's the only place we can do it\n\n## Rejection\n- Receiving it and giving it\n- If you reject nothing you are valueless/directionless\n- **To value X, we must reject not(X)**\n- Good relationships involve rejection\n\t- Reject taking responsibility for others values/feelings\n\t- Dont fear the small fights\n\t- Conflict is a good test of love\n- Consumerism --\x3e Have more\n- Rejection --\x3e Have less\n\n## Mortality\n- You are going to die anyway, why be afraid of anything you do beforehand?\n- You fear death when you are unhappy with your life experiences\n\n\n"},{id:"how-to-lie-with-statistics",title:"How to Lie With Statistics",author:"Darryl Huff",date:"2020-09-02",stars:"4",isbn:"0393310728",content:"\nHuff wrote this book to show how people use statistics to put forward a false picture of the world. It's a short book, and one that I would recommend reading. I think tricks of the trade have moved beyond the things he discusses in the book, but it is still good, quick reading and not a half bad introduction into the basics of statistics, only from the perspective of how they can be misleading. \n\n## Bad Samples\n- Selection bias \u2013 Sample not representative of population\n- Small sample size \u2013 Choose sample size of 10 and use natural variation to find a result with 90% success (opposite of law of large numbers)\n- Are samples truly random \u2013 \u201cDoes each element in the population have equal chance of being picked in the sample\u201d\n\n## Averages\n- Arithmetic mean\n\t- Sensitive to outliers\n\t- Harder to understand with non-symmetric distributions\n- Median\n\t- Half observations above, half below\n- Mode\n\n## Statistical Significance\n- Combination of Multiple Comparison Problem and small sample sizes = Apparently strong results, but with no statistical significance\n- What is the t-stat?\n- What is the p-value?\n- What is the standard deviation?\n- What is the standard range of values?\n\n## Ranges\n- Whenever you sample, then take statistics of the sample, there is a confidence interval around these numbers (eg. Average of 98 is actually 95% confident it is between 96 and 102)\n- Whenever there is a sample, ask what the range is\n\n## Graphs\n- Watch out for scale\n- Might not start at 0\n\n## Pictographs\n- Suppose you show the growth of alcohol sales by a bottle twice as tall. In reality a bottle is a 3D object, so you have increased the bottle size by 8, misleading the image viewer\n- Images are drawn in 2D but viewed in 3D\n\n## Irrelevant Figures\n- If you can\u2019t prove something, prove something similar and pretend they\u2019re the same thing\n\n## Statisticulation\n- Be overly specific (don\u2019t round)\n- Fun with percentages\n- Percentage points vs %\n- Percentiles (remember the distribution!!!)\n- Geometric vs Arithmetic averages\n\n## Looking Out for Bad Stats\n1.

The main idea is to think of a book as a conversation with the author: What are they trying to tell you, and what questions do you have? \n\nIf on the other hand the book is more creative (fiction, poetry, etc), then the main goal is simply to experience the story. \n\n## 4 Questions For A Book\n\n1. **What is the book about as a whole?** - Understand the theme of the book\n2. **What is being said in detail, and how?** - Main ideas and arguments put forth\n3. **Is the book true, in whole or in part?** - Make up your own mind\n4. **What of it?**\n  - Why is the information in the book important\n  - Why does the author think so\n  - What further actions (if any) are implied\n\n## 4 Levels Of Reading\n\n### 1 Elementary Reading\n  - The kind of reading you learn in school\n  - If you cant do this you can't read a book\n  \n### 2 Inspectional Reading\n- **Systematic Skimming / Pre-reading**\n\t- Should take less than an hour\n\t- Aim to find out if the book is worth analytical reading\n\t- Get an idea of the macro structure of the book\n- **Superficial Reading**\n\t- Read it through without stopping if you don't understand something\n\t- Books are always easier the second time around\n\n### 3 Analytical Reading\n\n1. **Finding out what a book is about** (Answers question 1)\n    a. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter\n    b. State what the whole of the book is about with utmost brevity\n    c. Highlight the major parts in order and relation to one and other. Outline them as you did the whole\n    d. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve\n\n2. **Finding out what is being said in detail, and how** (Answers question 2)\n    a. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his keywords\n    b. Grasp the author's leading propositions by dealing with the most important sentences\n    c. Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences\n    d. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not. As to the latter, decide which the author knew he failed to solve\n\n\n3. Stage 3\n    a. **General Maxims of Intellectual Etiquette** (Answers question 3)\n        1. Do not begin criticism of the book until you have completed your outline and interpretation of the book\n        2. Do not agree disputatiously or contentiously\n        3. Demonstrate you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgement you make\n    b. **Special Criterial for Points of Criticism** (Answers question 4)\n        1. Show wherein the author is **uninformed**\n        2. Show wherein the author is **misinformed**\n        3. Show wherein the author is **illogical**\n        4. Show wherein the author's analysis or account is **incomplete**\n\n### 4 Synoptical Reading\n\n1. **Stage 1**\n    a. Create a tentative bibliography of the subject in question\n    b. Inspectionally read all books in the bibliography to figure out which are most important\n\n2. **Stage 2**\n    a. **Step 1 - Find the relevant passages** (Relevant to the question at hand)\n    b. **Step 2 - Bring the authors to terms**\n        - Establish terms yourself\n        - Put all the authors in the same language (your language)\n    c. **Step 3 - Get the questions clear**\n        - Existence/character of the idea you are investigating\n        - How the idea is known/manifests itself\n        - The consequences of the answers to 1 and 2\n\n    d. **Step 4 - Define the issues**\n        - Ensure disagreement is not due to different conceptions of the question\n\n    e. **Step 5 - Analyse the discussion**\n        - Be objective - \"Look at all sides and take no sides\"\n\n## Approaches to Different Kinds of Reading Matter\n\n### Practical Books\n1. Books about clear rules\n2. Books about the principles that generate the rules\n  - **Specific questions**\n    a. What are the authors _objectives_?\n        - Everything depends on _the goal_ the book is trying to help you attain\n        - Be open to the authors arguments as to why the goal is worth acheiving\n    b. What are his _means_ of achieving them?\n        - **Agreeing/Disagreeing**\n            - If you agree, you must take action in accordance with the book\n            - Consider rule 4. Does the author solve the problem he set out to?\n\n### Imaginative Literature\n  - **Don'ts**\n    - Don't resist the effect the book has on you\n    - Don't look for terms, propositions and arguments\n    - Don't criticize the book based on truth\n  - **Structural**\n    - Classify the book according to it's kind\n    - Grasp the unity of the book\n    - Discover how the whole is constructed of its parts\n  - **Interprative**\n    - Elements of fiction are it's episodes and incidents\n    - Terms are connected in propositions\n  - **Criticism**\n    - Don't criticize the book unless you fully appreciate what the author is trying to get across\n\n### Stories, Plays and Poems\n  - No action (of the analytical sense) is required of you when reading this kind of literature\n  - To read it well, all you have to do is experience it\n  - Read it quickly and with total immersion\n\n### History\n1.  Read **Like a Story**\n2.  Read **Multiple Accounts**: History is biased, you must read more than one account of a period to understand it\n3. Read to **Understand Man**: Read history not only to learn about that period, but also to learn the way men act in all times\n\n### Science and Maths\n- State as clearly as you can the problem the author is trying to solve (most important question to answer)\n- Your goal is not to become competent in the subject matter but to _understand the problem_\n\n### Philosophy\n\n#### Two Types of Questions\n1. Those concerned with _what is_ or what happens in the world\n    a. First order\n    b. Second order - Questions about first order questions\n2. Those concerned with what _should or ought to be_\n\n#### Philosophical Styles\n1. Philosphical Dialogue (eg. Plato) - Conversational style between individuals\n2. Philosophical **Treatises/Essays** (eg. Aristotle, Kant)\n3. Meetings of **Objections**\n4. **Systematisation of Philosophy** (eg. Descartes, Spinoza) - Attempt to organise philosophy like mathematics\n5. **Aphoristic** Style (eg. Nietsche)\n    - A lot of thinking is left to the reader\n        - What question is the author trying to answer?\n        - Find author's _controlling principles_ (the unstated assumptions of the author)\n        - Respect the assumptions\n        - Read other philosophers writings on the same subject\n\n### Social Science\n- \\= Books dedicated to the pirsuit of systematic knowledge of human society\n- **Easy to read**\n- **Hard to read**\n- These books are on the topics people are most opinionated about\n- Many terms in social sciences have very vague and broad meanings\n- Hardest question to answer: _What kind of book is this?_\n- Social science must be read synoptically"},{id:"algorithms-to-live-by",title:"Algorithms to Live By",author:"Brian Christian & Tom Griffiths",date:"2020-02-12",stars:"5",isbn:"9781627790369",content:'References: Algorithms\n\n## Optimal Stopping\n- The decision is not which option to pick\n- But how many options to consider\n- The **secretary problem**\n\t- You are interviewing secretaries\n\t- You can accept them or reject them\n\t- Once rejected they are gone forever\n\t- You can only compare secretaries by preference (ordinal / ranking)\n\t- How do you try to get the best?\n- Optimal\n\t- View 37% (1/e) of applicants\n\t- Then choose the next one that beats all the ones beforehand\n\t- "Look then leap"\n\t- Chance of getting the best applicant is 37% (even if there are 1,000,000 applicants)\n- Can be applied to either time or quantity\n- Modifications:\n\t- Can be rejected --\x3e Start making offers earlier\n\t- Can go back to previous applicants --\x3e Start making offers later\n\t- Cardinality --\x3e **Threshold rule** where you take anyone over a certain threshold\n- The passing of time makes everything an optimal stopping problem\n\n## Explore / Exploit\n- Do we try new things or stick with our favourite ones?\n- Exploration = Gathering information\n- Exploitation = Using information\n- **Multi-Armed Bandit Problem**\n\t- Many slot machines with different odds of winning\n\t- You have a limited number of spins\n\t- How do you balance trying new ones with playing the best ones\n- Solutions\n\t- The value of exploration only goes down over time\n\t- So try new things (explore) early on, leaving time to exploit this information later on\n\t- **Stick on the winner** - Stay playing the winning slot until it loses, then move on (this is statistically better than random)\n\t- **Regret minimisation** - Choose the option where the top end of the confidence interval is best (essentially be optimistic)\n- Studies show that people generally tend to **over** explore\n\n## Sorting\n- Scale is painful in sorting theory\n- Big-O notation: Denotes an algorithms worst case scenario\n- Solutions\n\t- Bubble sort: O(n^2)\n\t- Insertion sort: O(n^2)\n\t- Divide and conquer: \n\t- **Merge sort**: O(n log n)\n- n log (n) is the best possible (Mergesort)\n- Interesting problems arise when you add **noise** to the comparisons (ie they arent always correct, eg. Sports games)\n- Sorting is not necessary if searching is easy (think of an email inbox)\n\n## Caching\n- Cache = Short term memory\n- The problem is: What do you (or the computer) forget once the cache is full? How do you keep the most important info?\n- Solutions\n\t- FIFO & LIFO\n\t- **Least Recently Used** = Best\n\t- Nogutchi filing system = One pile of paper, put back on top when done using it, then always start searching from the top\n- The "forgetting curve"\n\n## Scheduling\n- If you only have one machine, then doing all the tasks will take the same amount of time. Hence scheduling is not important\n- If you have two machines (washing machine and drier)\n- Solutions\n\t- **Shortest Processing Time**: Start with the task that will be done fastest\n\t- Priority weighted to do list (Order by priority weight divided by time to complete)\n\t- Priority inheritance - If you have something low priority that needs to be done before something high priority, then it too is high priority\n- **Thrashing**\n\t- Context switching carries a cost, so minimising it is beneficial\n\t- Thrashing is excessive context switching, you should avoid this\n\t- Batching helps with this\n\t- So does rejecting new tasks\n- Metastablility\n\t- Not doing anything because you dont know what to do\n\t- Doing something always better than nothing\n\t- Pomodoros good for this (establish a minimum time to spend on something)\n\n## Bayes Rule\n- Laplace\'s law\n- Bayes Rule\n\t- P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)\n- Lindy Effect\n- Distributions (p. 142 good for this)\n\t- Normal --\x3e Average prediction\n\t- Power Law --\x3e Multiply prediction\n\t- Erlang --\x3e Additive prediction\n\n## Overfitting\n- Problem: **Bias variance tradeoff**\n- Solutions\n\t- Cross validation\n\t- Penalizing complexity\n\n\n## Relaxing\n- **Constraint relaxation**\n\t- Solve a similar problem with fewer constraints\n\t- *What would you do it you werent afraid?*\n\t- *What would you do if you couldnt fail?*\n\t- *What would you do if all jobs paid the same?*\n- Continuous relaxation\n- Lagrangean relaxation\n\n## Randomness\n- Sampling\n\t- Large enough samples represent data well\n\t- Collecting data is key: Make sure you have truly random samples first\n- Monte carlo method = Random simulation\n- Simulated annealing \n- Randomness for good\n\t- Randomness --\x3e Creativity\n\t- The idea of the **random wiki link** on your computer\n\n## Networking\n- All network communication starts with **protocols**\n- Eg. HTTP\n- "Packet switching"\n\t- Messages are atomised and input into a stream of data\n\t- Responses are sent as ACKs that show message has been received\n- "Exponential backoff" - Delay the next attempt to contact the person by double the delay last time you tried\n- Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD)\n\t- Add things\n\t- When you hit a threshold, cut off a certain % of them\n- Buffering\n\t- Prevents taildrop\n\t- Humans dont have taildrop\n\n\n## Game Theory\n- Recursion\n- "Levelling" in poker: Understanding the level your opponent is on and playing one level higher\n- Nash equilibria\n- **Algorithmic game theory** \n\t- About finding NEs using efficient algorithms\n\t- Takes into account not only the solution, but the computation effort of the players in finding the solution\n- Looking for dominant strategies\n- Nash equilibria are not always optimal\n- Mechanism design\n\t- Changing the rules of the game\n\t- Creating rules that you know will result in the behaviour you want\n\t- Evolution has done a lot of mechanism design (eg. Emotions)\n- Marriage is a prisoners dilemma problem\n- Information cascades\n\t- Rational theory of bubbles\n- Pure honesty: "If I design an algorithm that already optimises for you, you won\'t need to do anything"\n'},{id:"amusing-ourselves-to-death",title:"Amusing Ourselves to Death",author:"Neil Postman",date:"2019-12-02",stars:"4",isbn:"0140094385",content:'%%Refs: Technology addiction%%\n\n**Premise of the book:** The form in which ideas are expressed affects what those ideas will be. Postman was talking about television and Hollywood, but those same ideas relate just as well to the modern day world of Social Media.\n\n## Part 1\n\n### The Medium is the Metaphor\n- The medium through which we communicate dictates the subject of interactions and hence our culture\n- We are moving from the age of typography to the age of television and media\n\n### Media as Epistemology\n- **Epistemology =**  Subject concerned with the origins and nature of knowledge\n- Change in means of communication --\x3e Change in culture --\x3e Change in what is regarded as the truth\n- Certain forms of communication appear more truthful depending on the culture of society\n- Postman thinks epistemology of TV is inferior to that of print\n- Our culture has recently transitioned fromp **print to TV**\n- Postman believes TV damages public communication\n\n### Typographic America\n- 1600s - 1800s = Ben Franklin Era = Typographical USA\n- USA in the 1700s - **Everybody read books**\n- 1690 - Development of the newspaper\n- 1800s - Growth of lecture halls\n\n### The Typographic Mind\n- In typographic America, reading was not a passtime but the only means of communication\n- Typography produces content which ** always says something**\n- **Intelligent Typographical Mind** = Logical, rational, objective\n- Reading was the only means of understanding the world\n- Nowadays we think of famous people\'s faces, whereas we used to think of their words\n\n### The Peek-a-Boo World\n- Morse code lead to the growth of telegraphy, which disengaged transport from communication\n- Transition: Age of exposition --\x3e Age of show business\n- Morse code --\x3e Fast transmssion of information --\x3e Barrage of useless information\n- Information should induce action / change of plan (typography does, media doesnt)\n- Types\n\t- Telegraphy needs to be acknowledged\n\t  - Photography needs to be recognized\n\t  - Typography needs to be understood\n- Photography does not need context\n- **Photography + Telegraphy = Pseudo - Context = Peek-a-boo world**\n\n## Part 2\n\n### The Age of Showbusiness\n- TV as a medium creates an intellectual and social environment\n- All TV is entertainment, hence TV makes entertainment of everything\n- As TV defines our culture, it makes entertainment the medium of everything (we no longer talk to each other, we entertain each other)\n\n### "Now ... This"\n- **"Now ... This"** - Does not connect anything to anything.

And true to his nickname, he explains each concept brilliantly. \n\nEach idea is explained conceptually and in a way that makes sense to the layman. It's not mathematical at all. In fact I would say this is one of the best top-down primers to the subject of Physics that you can get. \n\nMy notes are below, but honestly, it isn't a long book and you'd do much better to get the explanations from Feynman than you would from my second hand interpretations.\n\n## Introduction\n- Feynman was against formalisms\n- He treated life like a big game\n- The role of **symmetry** and **conservation** are present throughout the book\n- He discovered a physical law regarding the weak force\n\n## The Law Of Gravitation\n- Gravitation is described by 2 equations\n      1. F = G(mm'/r2)\n      2. F = ma\n- **Kepler's** laws:\n      1. Orbits follow an ellipsis\n      2. Area between two radial vectors is always equal over the same stretch of time\n      3. Time to complete an orbit is proportional to (size of orbit)3/2\n- Physical laws allow us to discover new laws\n- Einstein made changes to Newton's laws to account for **relativity**\n- The law of gravitation does not apply on the **quantum scale** - there is no strong theory of quantum gravity\n- Physical laws are:\n      1. Mathematical in expression\n      2. Not exact\n      3. Simple, hence they apply widely\n- Stars are formed by gaseous blobs of dust grouping together thanks to gravity\n\n## The Relation Of Mathematics To Physics\n- Maths allows us to explain how things work, not why\n- Physics is inefficient in the sense that it does not build up from fundamental axioms like maths does\n- There are many ways to look at and think about the same theory\n      1. Newtons law\n      2. Local field theorem\n      3. Minimum principle\n- Mathematics is very generalist (eg. For n dimensions) whereas physics is applied (eg. N=3 dimensions)\n\n## The Great Conservation Principles\n- Almost all physical laws have the conservation laws in common\n- These laws allow physicists too discover new particles/laws by assuming the conservation laws hold\n- Conservation of energy can explain most of the other conservation laws\n- How does the theory of relativity impact the conservation principles? - pp65\n\n## Symmetry In Physical Law\n- Defn: Changes which have **no effect** on the physical laws\n- Symmetry and conservation laws are interlinked\n\nWorking symmetries:\n    1. Translation in space\n    2. Translation in time\n    3. Rotation in space\n    4. Relativity (uniform velocity in a straight line)\n\nNot working symmetries:\n    1. Change in scale (minimum limit due to particles)\n    2. Change in angular speed\n    3. Reflection in space\n\n- Electrons exit a beta decay spinning to the **left**\n- The world is not symmetrical if right and left are not the same - reflection in space does not work\n\n## The Disctinction Of Past And Future\nOn a fundamental level, all physical laws should work when time is moving backward. Take the coloured water example:\n- Even though light blue water would look weird splitting back up into clear and blue, it wouldn't look weird if a blue atom collided with a white one (it would look the same as if you played it forward)\n- A collision is random, so will look the same going backward\n- The water does not split back up into blue and clear, but it is not impossible, just highly unlikely\n\nWe have also reason to believe that Beta decay may not be time sensitive either. \n\nFinally a fun side note. 7.82m volts = an energy level in carbon. If this energy level did not exist then we would not have more than half the elements in the periodic table (nb: what is an energy level?)\n\n## Probability And Uncertainty\nThis chapter relates to the quantum mechanical view of nature\n- **Particles** - Discrete, experience no interference (\"bullets\")\n- **Waves** - Continuous, experience interference\n- Electrons are discrete, but experience interference unless you observe them by exposing them to light\n\nWave particle duality is best explained by the double-slit experiment (shout-out to my A level physics teacher Mr Rice)\n- There are two particles which have this feature\n      1. Light (photons)\n      2. Electrons\n- The probability of arrival of the electrons is distributed like the intensity of a wave\n- In this experiment, there is no way of predicting which hole the electron will pass through\n\n## Seeking New Laws\n- Particles explain most phenomena (at low energy)\n- If you combine all known laws of physics then you break some equations (things = infinity or divide by 0 etc) and so we know that they are missing something / something is wrong\n- To get new laws:\n      1. Guess\n      2. Compute results\n      3. Compare to the experiment\n- Most phenomena can be explained by:\n    1. Electrons\n    2. Photons\n    3. Gravitons\n    4. Neutrinos\n    5. Protons\n    6. Neutrons\n    7. ... And their anti particles\n- Sometimes, when looking for new laws you have to choose some of the existing laws to drop\n- Any good physicist knows multple theories for the same thing"},{id:"antifragile",title:"Antifragile",author:"Nassim Taleb",date:"2018-10-18",stars:"5",isbn:"9781400067824",content:'References: Antifragility | Risk\n\n## Antifragile: An Introduction\n- A little bit of something bad is good for you\n  - E.g Having a good competitor or using white noise to sleep\n- Information is antifragile\n- Certain jobs are more antifragile than others.

The old fashioned english used and the fact there is no organisation to the book (it\'s just one long piece of text) make it among the harder books to read. Especially at the start as you are just getting used to the language. \n\nThat being said, you\'ll be glad you read it when youre done. But if you still can\'t be arsed to read it. Take a look at my thoughts below. \n\n## Main Ideas\n\nBe a **good judge of character**. This way you can test who is worth your time and who is not\n\nBe **good to people**. Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it will help you in the future too.\n\n**Spend your time wisely**. What you do on a daily basis impacts the man you are in the future (--\x3e The Power of Habit)\n\n**Spend time with the right people**. Actively spend time with people who are good for you (intelligent and impressive), while removing those who are bad for you.\n\n**Have a set of values**. He wrote that the two principles that will make a poor mans fortune are above all others probity (Having strong morals) and integrity. Live by them and let them guide you, it will give you the reputation of being a well principled person\n\n**Read and learn insatiably**\n\n## 13 Virtues\nFranklin created for himself 13 characteristics that he wanted to develop. He tracked each of these habits individually, noting with a dot in his journal when he did not adhere to them. He began with number 1, and only moved onto the next one only once he had completed an entire week of no dots.\n\n1. **Temperance**. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\n2. **Silence**. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\n3. **Order**. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\n4. **Resolution**. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\n5. **Frugality**. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.\n6. **Industry**. Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\n7. **Sincerity**. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.\n8. **Justice**. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.\n9. **Moderation**. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.\n10. **Cleanliness**. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.\n11. **Tranquillity**. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\n12. **Chastity**. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another\'s peace or reputation.\n13. **Humility**. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\n## Reading & Writing\n\nFranklin read voraciously, and noted a few books that he learned a lot from\n1. On human understanding (Locke) - Combined with the below book to learn thought/philosophy\n2. The art of thinking (Messrs, du port royal)\n3. Memorable things of socrates (Xenophon) - To learn the socratic method\n\nHe also believed that his autobiography (and biographies in general) build indirect experience of events and lives\n\n## Thought and Opinion\n- Shared knowledge is better than knowledge kept secret\n- He wrote many essays, learning how to write well from a young age by arguing with a pen pal\n- The change inflicted by his essays show the power of a well thought through argument\n- If you wish improvement of knowledge then hold your opinions and thoughts loosely\n- Formed the **Junto Club** to disscuss important matters with his intelligent friends\n  - Matters of philosophy, politics, morals etc\n  - Each meeting someone would write an essay which was to be discussed in the meetings\n\n## Relationships\n- Lent a lot of money to his friends, he often was not paid back\n- He built and added to his network of "ingenious" people whenever he met someone clever\n- He **sought out the intelligent and impressive people** wherever he went, not just waiting to stumble upon them\n- How people see you is important, so you should make sure that your reputation is going to do you favours (Act as if)\n- Not only did he seek out intelligent people, he also removed those who were bad for him in a ruthlessly critical manner.\n- He found that people respond better to suggestions when you present them on behalf of a group not an individual, this is how Franklin sold subscriptions to the library for the junto club\n- "He that has done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another"\n- He was always judging the character of other people, by doing this he became very good at it. Shows the benefits of a **strong judge of character**\n- Being a good person makes people want to be lead by you. The 13 virtues were Franklins way of building the character necessary not only to be able to lead, but to be wanted as a leader\n- In the back of your mind, always be thinking in one way or another "how can I benefit others"\n\n## Hard Work\n- Many people called him the hardest worker he knew\n- One of his principles was "Industriousness" which he valued incredibly highly\n- **Spend your time wisely**. Once the library in Philadelphia was up and running he made the choice every day to spend time there instead of in the tavern. Replacing the education he says he did not get in the formal sense\n- When the going gets tough, a lot of people change their original goal to save some work, Franklin says this is not something to make a habit of as it leads to worse work\n- Never reject a position because you feel you are inexperienced, only if it is against your virtues\n\n## Commendable Acheivements\n- Founding the **junto club**\n- Started the first library in Philadelphia\n- Conducted the experiments which proved lightning is just electricity (lightning rods)\n- Set up the "Union Fire Company", essentially the first fire brigade\n- Wrote a book on science experiments'},{id:"how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people",title:"How to Win Friends and Influence People",author:"Dale Carnegie",date:"yyyy-mm-dd",stars:"5",isbn:"9780091906818",content:'\n## Fundamental Techniques In Handling People\n\n1. **Don\'t criticize, condemn or complain**\n  - Any fool can complain, it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving\n\n2. **Give honest and sincere appreciation**\n  - There is only one way to get someone to do something, and that is by making them want to do it\n  - People crave to be appreciated\n\n3. **Arouse in the other person an eager want**\n  - In order to influence people you must talk about what they want and show them how to get it\n  - Before you speak, look at things from the other persons perspective and consider what they want\n\n## Six Ways To Make People Like You\n\n1. **Become genuinely interested in other people**\n  - They have a lot to offer and it is arrogant not to listen to them\n  - Don\'t try to make people interested in you!\n  - We are interested in others when they are interested in us\n  - Greet people with genuine enthusiasm\n\n2. **Smile**\n  - People succeed at things they have fun doing\n  - So do what you love, then tell your face!\n  - Actions speak louder than words\n\n3. **Remember that a person\'s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language**\n  - Remember and use people\'s names\n  - Saying someone\'s name is like a subconscious complement to them\n  - Try to associate their name with their features\n  - Ask them how to spell it\n\n4. **Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves**\n  - Listen because you are genuinely interested (and you should be)\n  - Give the person speaking your exclusive, undivided attention\n  - Ask questions that they will enjoy answering\n\n5. **Talk in terms of the other persons interests**\n  - Theodore Roosevelt stayed up the night before a dinner reading about topics that his guests were interested in\n  - Put effort into knowing about what they like to talk about\n\n6. **Make the other person feel important, and do so sincerely**\n  - The feeling of importance is one of the fundamental human desires\n  - Everyone feels themselves superior to you in some way, you can get to their hearts by recognizing and highlighting it\n  -  "Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours"\n\n## How To Win People To Your Way Of Thinking\n\n1. **The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it**\n  - Recognise that this argument is an opportunity for you to learn\n  - Listen to the other person first\n  - Look for areas of agreement\n  - Remember: Anyone that puts in the effort to argue with you is interested in the same things you are\n\n2. **Show respect for the other person\'s opinions. Never say "you\'re wrong"**\n  - You will never get into trouble for admitting that you might be wrong\n  - Be diplomatic in argument\n  - Highlight the knowledge of the other person\n\n3. **If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically**\n  - When we are right, we must try to win people gently and tactfully. When we are wrong we must admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm\n  - Say about yourself all the bad things the other person will say, and say them before they do\n  - Any fool can defend a mistake, it takes character to admit it was just an error\n\n4. **Begin in a friendly way**\n  - "A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall"\n  - Kindliness and a friendly approach can make people change their minds more easily than by forcing them\n\n5. **Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately**\n  - Socratic method - Get them to agree with statements then show how their argument disagrees with themselves\n  - Keep emphasising the things on which you agree\n  - Ask gentle questions that the other person will say yes to\n\n6. **Let the other person do a great deal of talking**\n  - People won\'t pay attention to you while they still have a lot they want to say, they will be waiting to speak\n  - This is best used when handling complaints\n\n7. **Let the other person feel like the idea is his or hers**\n  - We much prefer to feel that we are making decisions on our own accord\n  - Ask them what they want, then provide it for them. This way you have enabled their own idea\n\n8. **Try honestly to see things from the other persons point of view**\n  - Put yourself in their place\n  - Govern what you will say by what you would want to hear if you were the listener\n  - Think in terms of the other persons point of view\n\n9. **Be sympathetic with the other person\'s ideas and desires**\n  - Most people you meet are thirsty for sympathy - "I don\'t blame you"\n  - Don\'t just go blaming them, especially if they have made a mistake\n\n10. **Appeal to the nobler motives**\n  - People like to think they are following motives that sound good\n  - Make them feel that you regard them as honest, noble and fair\n\n11. **Dramatize your ideas**\n  - Merely stating a truth is not enough, the truth must be made vivid\n  - TV is dramatic and everyone loves it\n  - Showmanship makes a difference\n\n12. **When nothing else works, throw down a challenge**\n  - Stimulate competition\n  - People desire a feeling of importance. Competition and challenge provides this opportunity\n\n## Be A Leader: How To Change People Without Giving Offence Or Arousing Resentment\n\n1. **Begin with praise and honest appreciation**\n  - If you have to find fault, give a sincere complement first\n  - Make them feel important\n  - Then sympathise with them\n\n2. **Call attention to people\'s mistakes indirectly**\n  - Change the word "but" to "and"\n  - "I\'m proud your grades have got better, and if you keep it up your algebra will get better too"\n\n3. **Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person**\n  - People want to feel superior, by highlighting your own mistakes they can still feel so\n  - They will also identify with you more and hence you could make a friend\n\n4. **Ask questions instead of giving direct orders**\n  - This gives people the opportunity to choose to do things themselves\n  - You will save their pride and keep them feeling important\n  - This also gives them more room to be creative\n\n5. **Let the other person save face**\n  - What matters is what people think of themselves, so make it good\n  - Allow them to stay feeling important\n\n6. **Praise the slightest improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise"**\n  - Be specific in your praise for it to be more sincere\n  - You must genuinely believe it though\n  - People improve when you encourage them and get worse when you condemn them\n\n7. **Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to**\n  - People will feel important provided that they live up to their reputation\n  - Give a dog a good name\n\n8. **Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct**\n  - You want to incentivise them to improve\n  - Let them know you have faith in their ability\n  - Let them know that they have an undeveloped flair for their work\n\n9. **Make the other person happy about doing things you suggest**\n  - Point out the benefits to them of doing what you suggest\n  - Give others authority'},{id:"influence",title:"Influence",author:"Robert Cialdini",date:"2019-09-07",stars:"5",isbn:"9780061241895",content:'References: Psychology\n\nA classic for a reason.  The book is very well organised, you never find yourself lost or wondering "how does this relate to the book/chapter?".  Each chapter explains one characteristic of human psychology and how it can be used to influence an individual. But so as to not sound so evil, the approach is how to be aware of these tactics and prevent others from applying them on you. Still though, wouldn\'t stop you using them the other way around.\n\n## Weapons of Influence\n- Animals commonly react to "trigger features" which they use as shortcuts\n- Humans do the same\n- These shortcuts create "weapons of influence" which people can use against you\n- Eg.\n  - Because Principle: People are more likely to comply if you give a reason\n  - Expensive = Good: People expect to get what they pay for\n  - Contrast Principle: Everything is relative\n\n## Reciprocation\n- You feel obliged to repay those that gave you a gift or did you a favour (this can be exploited)\n- "Reject then retreat" = Making a cconcession so that the other party will too\n- Prevent this by seeing gifts/favours as sales devices and tricks of the trade\n- This combines with the contrast principle when "rejection then retreat" is used\n- It can overpower how to feel about someon\n- It also prompts unfair exchanges\n- If you are using this tactic - Don\'t be too unreasonable with your first request\n\n## Commitment and Consistency\n- Humans have an obsession to appear consistent\n- Initial commitment --\x3e Act in a manner **consistent with your commitment**\n  - You must take **inner responsibility** for the commitment\n- We view ourselves through the lens of the actions we take\n- Then we comply and act in accordance with this self-image\n- The more public the commitment the stronger the need for consistency\n- Putting more effort into commiting to something --\x3e More consitsent\n- No strong outside pressure --\x3e **Inner responsibility**\n- "Lowballing"\n- "If I knew what I know now, would I make the same choice?"\n\n## Social Proof\n- We use the actions of others to determine what is right/correct when:\n  - We are uncertain\n  - Those people are similar to us\n- **Pluralistic ignorance** = Everybody does nothing because everybody else is doing nothing\n  - Strongest among strangers\n- To force an action (eg. Getting help during an attack), you must be specific - Tell a specific person to do a specific thing\n- Avoiding the trap\n  - Look for fake instances of social proof so you know when to get off autopilot\n  - Look out for the crowd acting foolishly, there is a good chance they know no more than you do\n\n## Liking\n- People like\n  - Physical attractiveness\n  - Those similar to themselves\n  - Compliments\n  - Cooperation (people you have cooperated with)\n- Watch out for people who are suspiciously similar to you\n- In order to produce liking, cooperation should not be unpleasant\n- You and others form an opinion of you based on what you are associated with\n  - Hence why we try hard to make public good associations and to hide bad ones (works both ways)\n- Watch out for times you seem to like people too much / too quickly\n- Association --\x3e Food\n\n## Authority\n- We are unable to defy authority\n- We obey automatically, not considering the pros/cons\n- The **appearance of authority is enough**:\n  \ta. Titles - MD, Dr\n  \tb. Clothes - Uniform, suit etc\n  \tc. Trappings - Expensive clothes, cars\n- Question the expertise of authorities to get past their appearance\n- Is the expert trustworthy?\n- Watch out - Authority figures may make initial concessions to appear on your side/more honest\n\n## Scarcity\n- Opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availabiltiy is limited\n- Same applies to the time available - "deadline tactic"\n- **Psychological reactance theory** = When free choice is limited, the need to retain our freedom makes us desire that which is scarce\n- Scarce information is more convincing\n- The principle is stronger when:\n  - The item has recently become more scarce\n  - Scarcity is caused by social competition (other people buying the last ones)\n- Say no by\n  - Focusing on the use of the item and not its scarcity\n  - Remember the function of the item is not affected by its availablility'},{id:"the-prince",title:"The Prince",author:"Niccolo Machiavelli",date:"2019-02-16",stars:"4",isbn:"8601300102429",content:'%%\nPower\n%%\n\n\nBefore getting onto my notes, I\'d like to say that whenever people ask me about Robert Greene\'s book "The 48 Laws of Power", I tell them to read this instead. It is an absolute classic on ruthless strategy and contains the majority of the ideas that Greene talks about. It\'s also the source he probably references the most in his book.\n\nNow onto the notes...\n\n> Approaches politics and power realistically, not idealistically. A Prince should do what is necessary to achieve power whether it is good or evil. Essentially a book of instructions on how to be a tyrant\n\nBefore breaking down the book, I took some general ideas from throughout which I\'ve bullet pointed below. \n\nGeneral princely advice:\n- Any injury a prince does to a man should be so severe that he does not fear vengeance\n- Have foresight and implement countermeasures (especially in war, which should be ideally prevented)\n- Do not depend on others\n- Men must be either won over or destroyed\n- Cruelty used well does not persist, it is a necessary evil for the good of ones subjects and not a tool to be used too frequently\n- When inflicting injuries, do so in a "once for all" manner. Don\'t drag it out\n- The key is not to be hated\n- A prince should strive to do good, but know how to do evil if it is necessary\n- A prince will always have two main fears\n\t1. Internal subversion\n\t2. External attack\n\n## Principalities\n\n### Hereditary Principalities\n- Dismissed as easy to manage\n- The people are accustomed to the rule of the family already\n\n### Mixed / Composite Principalities\n- = An appendage to an existing state\n- Difficult to manage, as \n\t1. You are hated by those you conquer\n\t2. You have to integrate potentially different cultures/laws\n- Upon conquer, a prince must\n\t1. Destroy the old family\n\t2. Not change laws of taxes\n\t3. Settle within the Principality to keep his ear to the ground\n\t4. Befriend small neighbours by becoming their protector\n\t5. Weaken the power of stronger neighbours\n- States with more centralised power (eg Turks) are harder to conquer, but easier to maintain power over, than states with less centralised power (eg France)\n- How to administer states with their own laws, either:\n\t1. Devastate them\n\t2. Go and live there in person\n\t3. Let them keep their own laws\n\n### New Principalities\n1. Acquired by **own arms**\n\t- Acquired with difficulty \n\t\t- Did all work themself\n\t\t- Have to implement new laws and institutions\n\t- Maintained with ease - If youre good enough to take it youre good enough to keep it\n2. Acquired by **others arms** (fortune)\n\t- Acquired with ease - someone else does it\n\t- Maintained with difficulty - dependent on help of others\n3. Acquired by **crime**\n\t- May win a prince power but no glory\n4. Acquired by the **approval of fellow citizens** ("constitution")\n\t- When either the **people or the nobles** choose to increase the standing of one of their members to have more power as a group\n\t- People have more power than nobles in aggregate, they should be focussed on more\n\n## Military & Arms\n- Strength of a principality measured by its ability to stand alone (independence)\n- Troops a Prince can use\n\t1. **His own** - Good\n\t2. **Mercenaries** - Bad as they cannot be trusted\n\t3. **Another states** (auxiliary) - Worst, as you become dependent on another state (better to lose with your own forces than win thanks to someone elses)\n- The art of war\n\t- The number 1 job of a rules is military strategy\n\t- Preparation in times of peace to be ready in times of war\n\t\t- Prepare the **mind** with military strategy and knowledge of history\n\t\t- Prepare the **body** by growing accustomed to hardship\n\n## Qualities of a Prince\n- Good and bad qualities are not so clear cut\n- A prince should appear to have all the good qualities and none of the bad, but if it comes to it, he should embody the bad qualities insofar as it maintains his rule\n- Generosity is good, however it makes you poor - Miserliness is OK\n- Compassion is good, however it makes you appear a pushover - Cruelty keeps a state united and loyal\n- **Fear vs Love** - It is better to be feared than loved, but ideally both\n- A prince should honour his word, but if it is necessary to break this then he should\n- Avoiding hatred\n\t- At all costs, this leads to insurgence and loss of power\n\t- The people are key, dont make them hate you\n\n## Prudence of a Prince\n- Earn honour by\n\t1. Great campaigns & demonstrations of ability\n\t2. Revealing himself as a true friend or true enemy (being irresolute shows fear)\n\t3. Honour those who are talented and excel\n- Choosing ministers\n\t- Those who think always of the prince and not themselves\n\t- Make them dependent on you (removes insurgence)\n\t- Demand honesty \n\t\t- Do not tolerate flattery from ministers, it is not useful\n\t\t- Allow these to be the core people who can speak candidly to you\n\n## Fortune vs Freedom\n- He says it is "fortune is the arbiter of about half the things"\n- Men have certain characteristics, and policy sometimes calls for those characteristics --\x3e You are fortunate if the current environment requires your characteristics and unfortunate if not'}]},68:function(e,t,n){e.exports=n(106)},73:function(e,t,n){},74:function(e,t,n){},75:function(e,t,n){},76:function(e,t,n){},77:function(e,t,n){}},[[68,1,2]]]);
