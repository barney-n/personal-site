It fills you with a sense of child-like adventure. Finnegan spent his life scratching his itch for surfing. Chasing the best waves in the world. Along the way its clear he kept detailed journals. Because the depth he goes into when telling stories from his childhood and young adult years is what makes the book so great. It's an autiobiography, but the quality of the storytelling lends an element of fiction to it as well (as with all good biographies). \n\nFinnegan grew up in California but the family moved to Hawaii at a young age. Both great surfing destinations of course, and Hawaii seems to be the place that he really came into his own as an independent surfer. After leaving school and being in and out of university, he set off on a mission to circumnavigate the world, chasing the globes best waves with a friend of his, Bryan. After about 2 years of doing exactly that, he settled down in South Africa for a while to teach at a school and surf some of the local waves. Eventually he moved back home to California where he tells stories of the undergroud surfing scene there that most are unaware of. The book finishes up with him in New York, writing full time as a journalist and often running off to New York's (much colder) waves.\n\nThroughout the book a few things stick out.\n\n**A \"way of life\"**: The love of surfing has been a rare constant throughout his life. Over 40 years since starting, he will still drop what he is doing at a moment's notice and run off with a wetsuit to catch a wave in the freezing cold seas of New York. It really makes you want to find your own passion, whatever your own version of surfing is. \n\n**Risking it all for a wave**: Along a similar vein, the risks of injury that himself and his friends often took is impressive. A lifelong passion yes. But never anything more than the next wave. Surfers dont look at the sport as a whole very often. Instead they think \"is it worth it for this wave?\". The answer is almost always yes.\n\n**Surfing friendships**: Finnegan made new friends through surfing from the age of 14 all the way through to 40. Never short of a kind person to share the sport with.\n\n**Growth through travel**: By meeting new people and seeing new cultures, he clearly developed a new way of looking at the world. A more complete one. In moving to Hawaii with his family he had left western culture. And travelling in his 20s simply continued to widen his perspective. \n\n**Always writing**: This may not surprise many people, but as a budding writer and journalist he was always writing. Journals for his personal use. Articles for travel and surf magazines. A novel of his own. This shouldn't surprise that many, but it's worth noting that, as usual, the best way to do what you want to do professionally is to do a shit-load of it non-professionally first. There's rarely a short cut. \n\n\n"},{"id":"the-proud-highway","title":"The Proud Highway","author":"Hunter S Thompson","date":"2023-04-11","stars":"5","isbn":"9781408822937","content":"I really enjoyed this. Thompson is a breath of fresh air and this comes through nowhere more clearly than in his letters. It's rare that the history of someones writing is documented so well from the early years of their life (this book starts with letters he wrote at 17, and ends in his 30s).\n\nIt's certainly not the perfect example of how to live. He continued to make the same mistakes many times, and made a lot of decisions that happened to work out for him but probably wouldn't in most cases. \n\nThat being said, it is certainly a lesson in living. You can't help but be inspired to do something more outrageous and different in your life as a result of reading the views of this man. \n\nFavourite quotes below:\n\n# Work\n- \"Gonzo, he wrote, “is a style of ‘reporting based on William Faulkner’s idea that the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism\"\n- \"Also, without the slightest exaggeration, I drink approximately 20 cups of coffee every 24 hours and manage to sleep about 5 hours a night.\"\n- \"Instead of battling my environment, I enjoy my work tremendously and put in about 15 hours a day at it—for the simple reason that I like to write.\"\n- \"I just keep wandering around, doing all these things and not worrying about what the results will be.

Nor do I particularly seek money, except in the form of having my expenses covered in what I undertake\"\n- \"I am half mad from the silence I have imposed upon myself in Woody Creek, and when I find myself among human beings I tend to explode.\"\n- \"Whether you are a journalist or not, the only way to attempt journalism is to assume you know nothing at the start, and then only write what you find evidence to support\"\n- \"Right now I should be writing my new “column” in Ramparts, but I can’t get up the zap for it.\" -*Proof he never works, just does what he loves and gets paid for it*\n\n# Life Experience\n- \"Who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived, or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?\"\n- \"Has he any self-respect or pride in himself?

Siddhartha does nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall. His goal attracts him, because he doesn’t let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal.\"\n-  \"“Surely,” Siddhartha laughed, “surely I have travelled for my amusement. For what else? I have gotten to know people and places, I have received kindness and trust, I have found friendship.\"\n-  \"Slowly the disease of the soul, which rich people have, grabbed hold of him.\"\n-  \"He had been captured by the world, by lust, covetousness, sloth, and finally also by that vice which he had used to despise and mock the most as the most foolish one of all vices: greed.\"\n-  \"thus this sleepless man wished to free himself of these pleasures, these habits and all of this pointless life and himself,\"\n-  \"“It is good,” he thought, “to get a taste of everything for oneself, which one needs to know.\"\n-  \"He had died, a new Siddhartha had woken up from the sleep.\"\n-  \"Most of all, he learned from it to listen, to pay close attention with a quiet heart, with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, without judgement, without an opinion.\" -  *The river*\n-  \"Which father, which teacher had been able to protect him from living his life for himself, from soiling himself with life, from burdening himself with guilt, from drinking the bitter drink for himself, from finding his path for himself?\"\n-  \"But even if you would die ten times for him, you would not be able to take the slightest part of his destiny upon yourself.”\" -  *Each must live their own life*\n-  \"He’s doing what you’ve failed to do yourself.\"\n-  \"He’s doing what you’ve failed to do yourself. He’s taking care of himself, he’s taking his course. Alas,\"\n-  \"He’s doing what you’ve failed to do yourself. He’s taking care of himself, he’s taking his course.\" -  *Nobody else can take your course for you*\n-  \"he understood them, he understood and shared their life,\"\n-  \"what wisdom actually was, what the goal of his long search was. It was nothing but a readiness of the soul, an ability, a secret art, to think every moment, while living his life, the thought of oneness, to be able to feel and inhale the oneness.\"\n-  \"In this hour, Siddhartha stopped fighting his fate, stopped suffering. On his face flourished the cheerfulness of a knowledge, which is no longer opposed by any will, which knows perfection, which is in agreement with the flow of events, with the current of life, full of sympathy for the pain of others, full of sympathy for the pleasure of others, devoted to the flow, belonging to the oneness.\"\n-  \"Perhaps that you’re searching far too much? That in all that searching, you don’t find the time for finding?”\"\n-  \"That in all that searching, you don’t find the time for finding?”\"\n-  \"started to distrust teachers and teachings and to turn my back to them. I have stuck with this.\"\n-  \"Knowledge can be conveyed, but not wisdom. It can be found, it can be lived, it is possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it cannot be expressed in words and taught.\"\n-  \"To thoroughly understand the world, to explain it, to despise it, may be the thing great thinkers do. But I’m only interested in being able to love the world, not to despise it, not to hate it and me, to be able to look upon it and me and all beings with love and admiration and great respect.”\""},{"id":"how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster","title":"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster","author":"Bill Gates","date":"2023-02-12","stars":"No stars given","isbn":"9780385546140","content":"%%Climate Change | Clean Energy%%\n\n## Why Zero?\n- What we need to do\n\t- 52 billion tons of greenhouse gas emitted each year\n\t- Need that to be 0\n\t- Cant just emit less, as that still adds to stock of gases in the atmosphere\n- Hotter = Harder to live\n\t- Worse storms\n\t- More frequent storms\n\t- Droughts\n\t- Wildfires\n\t- Floods\n\t- Animals cant survive\n\t- Faster spread of disease\n- Zero carbon can mean we produce some carbon but also remove some\n- Greenhouse gases\n\t- Carbon Dioxide\n\t- Nitrous Oxide\n\t- Methane\n- They trap heat in the atmosphere, like a greenhouse\n\t- Correct wavelength to let heat in\n\t- When reflected back, they trap heat inside the ozone layer\n\n## Challenges\n- Fossil fuels are in bloody everything\n\t- Plastic\n\t- Concrete\n\t- Cement\n\t- Steel\n\t- Fertiliser\n\t- Construction\n\t- Transport\n- Fossil fuels are **cheap**\n\t- Hard to get rid of them when market gravitates toward them\n- Population growth = More emissions naturally\n- Outdated laws and regulations\n- Need to force adoption of clean energy\n\t- Will be too slow otherwise\n\t- Global cooperation is very hard and usually too slow\n\n## 5 Questions to Ask\n1. **What percentage of the 52 billion tons are we talking about?**\n2. **What is the plan for cement?**\n\t- Massive polluter with no clearcut solution\n3. **How much power are we talking?**\n4. **How much space do we need?**\n\t- How much power are we getting per unit of area\n5. **How much will it cost?**\n\t- *Green Premiums* - What % excess does green solution cost\n\n## Key areas\n\n### Electricity (26%)\n- Zero carbon electricity can decarbonise a lot of other areas by **electrification**\n- Electricity is currently mostly produced by burning fossil fuels\n- Green premium in the west = 15% (Higher in poor countries)\n- **Storage**\n\t- Expensive to store electricity on a large scale (batteries too large and inefficient)\n\t- Makes it hard to account for the seasonality of sources like wind and solar\n- Carbon free electricity\n\t- Nuclear fission (splitting atoms)\n\t- Nuclear fusion\n\t- Solar\n\t- Wind\n\t- Hydro\n- *Big issue*: All renewable energy is **intermittent**, except for nuclear power (which is why it is so important)\n- Storage in:\n\t- Batteries\n\t- Pumped hydro\n\t- Thermal storage\n- Other solutions\n\t- **Carbon capture** - Will become big part of the future to offset what we cannot offset.

A. Book. I've always struggled with recommending people books. Thats why I share what I myself have read instead of telling others what to read. But this book has made that question so easy to answer. It is my number one go to book to reccomend to people. It's empowering in it's idea of individuality, and motivates you to follow your own way in life as opposed to conforming into something that deep down you know you are not. \n\nHoward Roark is the main character, and exemplifies all the ideas that Rand is writing about perfectly. He would undoubtedly be the most independent person you have ever met, if you were so lucky. \n\nThe essential essence of the book is around moving society forward through individuals making completely self interested decisions about the way they think the world should be. In this case it is Roark and his modernist style of architecture. It mocks what Rand calls the 'second handers' that simply mirror the opinions of others and follow the crowd. \n\nDont be a second hander.\n\n## Highlights\n\n\"It's for four years. But, on the other hand, Guy Francon offered me a job with him some time ago. Today he said it's still open. And I don't know which to take.\" Roark looked at him; Roark's fingers moved in slow rotation, beating\nagainst the steps. \"If you want my advice, Peter,\" he said at last, \"you've made a mistake already. By asking me. By asking anyone. Never ask people. Not about your work. Don't you know what you want? How can you stand it, not to know?\" \"You see, that's what I admire about you, Howard. You always\nknow.\"\n\"Drop the compliments.\"\n\"But I mean it. How do you always manage to decide?\" \"How can you let others decide for you?\"\n\"But you see, I'm not sure, Howard. I'm never sure of myself. I don't know whether I'm as good as they all tell me I am. I wouldn't admit that to anyone but you. I think it's because you're always so sure that\nI...\" \"Petey!\" Mrs. Keating's voice exploded behind them. \"Petey, sweet- heart! What are you doing there?\"\nShe stood in the doorway, in her best dress of burgundy taffeta, happy\nand angry.\n\"And here I've been sitting all alone, waiting for you! What on earth are you doing on those filthy steps in your dress suit? Get up this minute! Come on in the house, boys. I've got hot chocolate and cookies ready for you.\"\n\"But, Mother, I wanted to speak to Howard about something impor- tant,\" said Keating. But he rose to his feet.\nShe seemed not to have heard. She walked into the house. Keating followed.\nRoark looked after them, shrugged, rose and went in also.\nMrs. Keating settled down in an armchair, her stiff skirt crackling. \"Well?\" she asked. \"What were you two discussing out there?\"\nKeating fingered an ash tray, picked up a matchbox and dropped it, then, ignoring her, turned to Roark.\n\"Look, Howard, drop the pose,\" he said, his voice high. \"Shall I junk the scholarship and go to work, or let Francon wait and grab the Beaux- Arts to impress the yokels? What do you think?\"\nSomething was gone. The one moment was lost.\n\"Now, Petey, let me get this straight...\" began Mrs. Keating. \"Oh, wait a minute, Mother! . . . Howard, I've got to weigh it care fully. It isn't everyone who can get a scholarship like that. You're pretty\n\n---\nIt was right and it was good, that house growing under his hand, because men were still worshiping the masters who had done it before him. He did not have to wonder, to fear or to take chances; it had been done for him.\n\n---\n\"You call that freedom?\"\n\"To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend on nothing.\" \"What if you found something you wanted?\"\n\"I won't find it. I won't choose to see it. It would be part of that lovely world of yours. I'd have to share it with all the rest of you-and I wouldn't. You know, I never open again any great book I've read and loved. It hurts me to think of the other eyes that have read it and of what they were. Things like that can't be shared. Not with people like that.\"\n\n---\nThere was no such person as Mrs. Wayne Wilmot; there was only a shell containing the opinions of her friends, the picture postcards she had seen, the novels of country squires she had read; \n\n---\n\"Don't you know that most people take most things because that's what's given them, and they have no opinion whatever? Do you wish to be guided by what they expect you to think they think or by your own judgment?\"\n\n---\nKeating let himself be carried by the torrent. He needed the people and the clamor around him. There were no questions and no doubts when he stood on a platform over a sea of faces; the air was heavy, compact, saturated with a single solvent-admiration; there was no room for anything else. He was great; great as the number of people who told him so. He was right; right as the number of people who believed it. He looked at the faces, at the eyes; he saw himself born in them, he saw himself being granted the gift of life. That was Peter Keating, that, the reflection in those staring pupils, and his body was only its reflection.\n\n---\n\"It is so commonplace,\" she drawled, \"to be understood by every- body.\"\n\n---\nWhat is kinder-to believe the best of people and burden them with a nobility beyond their endurance or to see them as they are, and accept it because it makes them comfortable? Kindness being more important than justice, of course.\"\n\n---\n\"It's good to suffer. Don't complain. Bear, bow, accept-and be grateful that God has made you suffer. For this makes you better than the people who are laughing and happy. If you don't understand this, don't try to understand. Everything bad comes from the mind, because the mind asks too many questions. It is blessed to believe, not to under- stand. So if you didn't get passing grades, be glad of it. It means that you are better than the smart boys who think too much and too easily.\"\n\n---\nAnd as Roark looked at him, he added: \"Don't worry. They're all against me. But I have one advantage: they don't know what they want.\nI do.\"\n\n---\n\"That's true,\" whispered Keating. He would not have admitted it to anyone else.\n\"You missed the beautiful pride of utter selflessness. Only when you learn to deny your ego, completely, only when you learn to be amused by such piddling sentimentalities as your little sex urges-only then will achieve the greatness which I have always expected of you.\"\nyou \"You... you believe that about me, Ellsworth? You really do?\"\n\"I wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't. But to come back to love.\n\n---\n\"Yes, if it's your chief concern. Don't you see how egotistical it is? To\nhell with everybody so long as I'm virtuous.\"\n\n---\nHe recognized nothing but the accuracy of his own judgment. \n\n---\nThere was no order in his read- ing; but there was order in what remained of it in his mind.\n\n---\nWynand showed no interest in the previous standing of his prey. He showed no interest in men of glittering success who had commercialized their careers and held no particular beliefs of any kind. His victims had a single attribute in common: their immacu- late integrity.\n\n---\nBut you have to flatter people whom you despise in order to impress other people who despise you.\"\n\n---\n\"I'd rather...\" Then he cried: \"I'd rather you'd express an opinion,\nGod damn it, just once!\" She asked, in the same level monotone: \"Whose opinion, Peter? Gor- don Prescott's? Ralston Holcombe's? Ellsworth Toohey's?\"\n\n---\n\"You're beginning to see, aren't you, Peter? Shall I make it clearer? You never wanted me to be real. You never wanted anyone to be. But you didn't want me to show it. You wanted an act to help your act-a beautiful, complicated act, all twists, trimmings and words. All words. You didn't like what I said about Vincent Knowlton. You liked it when I said the same thing under cover of virtuous sentiments. You didn't want me to believe. You only wanted me to convince you that I be- lieved. My real soul, Peter? It's real only when it's independent-you've discovered that, haven't you? It's real only when it chooses curtains and desserts you're right about that-curtains, desserts and religions, Peter, and the shapes of buildings. But you've never wanted that. You wanted a mirror. People want nothing but mirrors around them. To reflect them while they're reflecting too. You know, like the senseless infinity you get from two mirrors facing each other across a narrow passage. Usually in the more vulgar kind of hotels. Reflections of reflec- tions and echoes of echoes. No beginning and no end. No center and no purpose. I gave you what you wanted. I became what you are, what your friends are, what most of humanity is so busy being-only without the trimmings. I didn't go around spouting book reviews to hide my emptiness of judgment-I said I had no judgment. I didn't borrow de- signs to hide my creative impotence-I created nothing. I didn't say that equality is a noble conception and unity the chief goal of mankind-I just agreed with everybody. You call it death, Peter? That kind of death-I've imposed it on you and on everyone around us. But you- you haven't done that. People are comfortable with you, they like you, they enjoy your presence. You've spared them the blank death. Because you've imposed it-on yourself.\"\nHe said nothing. She walked away from him, and sat down again, waiting.\n\n---\nEvery building is like a person. Single and unrepeat- able.\"\n\n---\n\"It is a masterpiece,\" said Jules Fougler. \"I hope you will prove yourself worthy of it, Peter. It is the kind of play that depends upon what the members of the audience are capable of bringing with them into the theater. If you are one of those literal-minded people, with a dry soul and a limited imagination, it is not for you. But if you are a real human being with a big, big heart full of laughter, who has preserved the uncorrupted capacity of his childhood for pure emotion-you will find it an unforgettable experience.\"\n\n---\nMany stole Cameron's forms; few understood his thinking. \n\n---\nI would stand and say: I am Gail Wynand, the man who has committed every crime except the foremost one: that of ascribing futility to the wonderful fact of existence and seeking justification beyond myself. This is my pride: that now, thinking of the end, I do not cry like all the men of my age: but what was the use and the meaning? I was the use and the meaning, I, Gail Wynand. That I lived and that I acted.\n\n---\n\"Howard, I'm a parasite. I've been a parasite all my life. You de- signed my best projects at Stanton. You designed the first house I ever built. You designed the Cosmo-Slotnick Building. I have fed on you and on all the men like you who lived before we were born. The men who designed the Parthenon, the Gothic cathedrals, the first skyscrapers. If they hadn't existed, I wouldn't have known how to put stone on stone. In the whole of my life, I haven't added a new doorknob to what men have done before me. I have taken that which was not mine and given nothing in return. I had nothing to give. This is not an act, Howard, and I'm very conscious of what I'm saying. And I came here to ask you to save me again. If you wish to throw me out, do it now.\"\n\n---\n\"Howard - anything you ask. Anything. I'd sell my soul ...\"\n\"That's the sort of thing I want you to understand. To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That's what everybody does every hour of his life. If I asked you to keep your soul - would you understand why that is much harder?\"\n\n---\nBoth are only the means of my work. Peter, before you can do things for people, you must be the kind of man who can get things done. But to get things done, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences. The work, not the people. Your own action, not any possible object of your charity. I'll be glad if people who need it find a better manner of living in a house I designed. But that's not the motive of my work. Nor my reason. Nor my reward.\"\n\n---\nThe only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself. My work done my way. \n\n---\n\"You'll get everything society can give a man. You'll keep all the\nmoney. You'll take any fame or honor anyone might want to grant. You'll accept such gratitude as the tenants might feel. And I-I'll take what nobody can give a man, except himself. I will have built Cort- landt.\"\n\n---\nI never think of myself in relation to anyone else. \n\n---\n\"I've looked at him-at what's left of him-and it's helped me to\nunderstand. He's paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he's been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness-in other people's eyes. Fame, admiration, envy-all that which comes from others. Oth- ers dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn't want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn't want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There's your actual selflessness. It's his ego that he's betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.\"\n\n---\n\"Aren't they all acting on a selfish motive - to be noticed, liked, admired?\"\n\n\"- by others. At the price of their own self respect. In the realm of great important - the realm of values, of judgement, of spirit, of thought - they place others abve self, in the exact manner which altruism demands. A truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others. He doesnt need it\"\n\n...\n\n\"That, precisely, is the deadliness of second-handers. They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They're concerned only with people. They dont ask 'Is this true?' They ask 'Is this what others think is true?' Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. What would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egotists. You dont think through anothers brain and you dont work through anothers hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent judgement, you suspent consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation. Anchored to nothing\"\n\n---\nIf any man stopped and asked himself whether he's ever held a truly personal desire, he'd find the answer. He'd see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other men. He's not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion-prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can't say about a single thing: 'This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me.' Then he wonders why he's unhappy. Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to be touched. \n\n---\nA self-sufficient ego.\n\n---\n\"We have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to recognize it,\" said another Wynand editorial. \"We have come to hold, in a kind of mawkish stupor, that greatness is to be gauged by self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice, we drool, is the ultimate virtue. Let's stop and think for a moment. Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convic- tions? The honesty of his feeling? The independence of his thought? But these are a man's supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. They, however, are above sacrificing to any cause or consideration whatsoever. Should we not, then, stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense? Self-sacrifice? But it is pre- cisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed. It is the unsacri- ficed self that we must respect in man above all.\"\n\n---\nToohey - \"The world I want. A world of obedience and of unity. A world where the thought of each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought in the brain of his neigh- bor who'll have no thought of his own but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor who'll have no thought-and so on, Peter, around the globe. Since all must agree with all. A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who'll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who'll have no desires-around the globe, Peter. Since all must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that headless monster-prestige. \"\n\n---\n\nEvery single thing I told you? Isn't Europe swallowed already and we're stumbling on to follow? Everything I said is contained in a single word collectivism. And isn't that the god of our century? To act together. To think- together. To feel-together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to sacrifice. Divide and conquer-first. But then-unite and rule.\n\n---\nAnything may be betrayed, anyone may be forgiven. But not those who lack the courage of their own greatness. Alvah Scarret can be forgiven. He had nothing to betray. Mitchell Layton can be forgiven. But not I. I was not born to be a second-hander.\n\n---\nThe misery of knowing how strong and able one is in one's own mind, the radiant picture never to be made real. Dreams? Self-delusion? Or a murdered reality, unborn, killed by that corroding emotion without name - fear - need - dependence - hatred?\n\n---\n\"Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received-hatred. The great creators-the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors- stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. \n\n---\n\"And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement.\n\"Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. Animals obtain food by force. Man has no claws, no fangs, no horns, no great strength of muscle. He must plant his food or hunt it. To plant, he needs a process of thought. To hunt, he needs weapons, and to make weapons-a process of thought. From this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstrac- tion, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man-the function of his reasoning mind.\n\"But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary conse- quence. The primary act-the process of reason-must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal among many men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They cannot be shared or transferred.\n\n---\nAnd here man faces his basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways-by the independent work of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of others. \n\n---\n\n\"Degrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree of a man's independence, initiative and personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker and his worth as a man. Inde- pendence is the only gauge of human virtue and value. What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or hasn't done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity. There is no standard of personal dignity except independence.\n\n...\n\n\"The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, pro- vided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty, his thinking, his work. But it\ndoes not include the sphere of the gangster, the altruist and the dictator. \"A man thinks and works alone. \n\n---\n\nRoark - \"I do not recognise anyone's right to one minute of my life.

Why Innovation Was Focused in Europe\n- **China**\n\t- Astronomical clock\n\t- Water wheel clocks & clepsydras (sand timers with water)\n\t\t- **Froze** in winter (same as in Europe)\n- **Middle East**\n\t- No trouble with cloudy skies or cold weather\n\t- Hence sundials and water clocks worked fine --> No innovation\n- Room for error\n- Europeans brought clocks to China\n- China did not take opportunity to copy and improve them\n- China did not need to know the time like Europe did\n- Communist china --> You do things when government says, not at a certain time\n- Clocks represented an insult to china\n\t- Clocks very Christian (telling you when to pray etc)\n- Interest in time measurement --> The clock (Not the other way around)\n- Popularity of clocks grew in line with developments in **Astronomy**\n- Also grew as **Christianity** grew (prayer times)\n- Monestary bells --> Timings for monks to increase productivity for God\n- Early turret clocks\n\t- Very expensive\n\t- A mark of prestige\n\n## 2. History of Horological Techniques\n\n- **Personalisation of time**\n\t- Miniturisation (1400s)\n\t\t- Allowed for portability\n\t\t- Birth of the watch\n\t\t- Who's watch was most accurate? <-- Status symbol\n\t\t- \"Privatisation\"/personalisation of time --> Individualism --> Growth of horology in Europe\n\t- War\n\t\t- Personal time was useful for military organisation\n- **Regional Focuses**\n\t- Main parts of horology development\n\t\t1. **English/Dutch**: Greater accuracy & measurement precision\n\t\t2. **Germans**: Greater complexity (minaturisation, advanced engineering)\n\t\t3. **French**: Development of the watch as an ornament of beauty\n\t- Drivers of accurate time measurement\n\t\t1. Astronomers\n\t\t2. Calculation of longitude at sea (longitude can be inferred from time differences at sea)\n\t\t\t- \"Dead reckoning\"\n\t\t\t- Britain announced big prize for whoever could solve this longitude problem\n- **Further Precision**\n\t- 1600s - Introduction of a minute hand\n\t- Galileo vs Huygens: Who invented the pendulum clock?\n\t- Industry ran into the verification problem\n\t\t- How do you know if your watch is accurate if you dont have an accurate watch to compare it to?\n\t- 1690s - Introduction of second and fractional second hands\n\t\t- In Britain to ensure bookies knew the winner of Horse races\n- **Reaching an Asymptote**\n\t- The last gains are the hardest and this was the point the industry was at\n\t- Improvements generally came in reduction of friction\n\t\t- Using crystals/rubies in watches\n\t\t- Adding oil regularly\n- **Longitude Problem Solved**\n\t- John Harrison\n\t\t- Englishman that solved the longitude problem with a clock he made from wood\n\t\t- His clock was called the H4\n- **French rise to challenge English dominance**\n\t- **Pierre Le Roy**\n\t\t- Arguably the greatest horologist to ever live\n\t\t- Chronometer (detend) escapement\n\t- Ferdinand Berthoud - Another french clockmaker\n\t- Patriotism drove the french horologists\n- **Arnold v Earnshaw**\n\t- In 1700s, **John Arnold** began to manufacture and industrialise the Chronometer\n\t- Ran into competition from Thomas Earnshaw\n\t- Large debate around the father of the English marine clock: Earnshaw vs Arnold\n\t- A pocket chronometer by either of these men would still work perfectly today\n\t- **One Second** = *9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of ground state of the cesium-133 atom*\n\n## 3. Who Made Clocks, and How\n- **Royal comissions**\n\t- Something unique to clockmaking in the 1700s-1800s was that maintenance was as costly and time consuming as production\n\t- \"Royally comissioned\"\n\t\t- Watchmaking was expensive, so initially horologists were comissioned by royalty and the ultra wealthy to make custom pieces\n- **Division of labour**\n\t- Driven by specialisation\n\t- Clockmaking broke down into\n\t\t- Master clockmaker - Owner of the shop and maker of designs/manufacturing process\n\t\t- Apprentices - Doing apprenticeship under a master\n\t\t- Journeymen - Completed apprenticeship but had not yet opened their own shop\n\t- Clockmakers guilds\n\t\t- Made to protect against competition\n\t\t- Had to be in the guild to sell clocks\n\t- Prevention of competition = Decreased innovation\n- **British Superiority**\n\t- Britain vs France\n\t- Industrial revolution\n\t\t- British horology enjoyed a century of superiority in the 1700s\n\t\t- Demand for watches in Britain grew as people had more money\n\t- Initiation of import wars on watches from france\n\t- Importing watches to copy them was a big market too\n- **Geneva**\n\t- Place of refuge for protestants in France\n\t- Had a highly skilled population\n\t- Had access to cheap labour in the farms of the mountains\n\t- Travelling merchants grew in importance\n\t\t- Knew what was popular\n\t\t- Transported watches\n- **The Swiss Jura**\n\t- Abundance of cheap labour\n\t- Low cost mass production\n\t- Made very cheap watches\n\t- Standardised parts --> Replaceable\n\t- Geneva made the custom beautiful watches, the jura mass produced for the standard person\n- **UK unable to compete with the Swiss**\n\t- \"Unification of time\"\n\t- As everyone needed to know the time --> Increased demand --> Benefits mass producers (Swiss Jura)\n\t- Policy blockades preventing Jura watches in UK were avoided with smuggling, etc\n\t- Growth of common time from: Railways, industrial work\n- **Growth of Swiss Industry**\n\t- Improvement of both quality and quantity from the Swiss\n\t- New swiss watchmakers were popping up to make new styles (eg. Patek Phillipe)\n\t- Swiss market too small --> Needed to export --> Made the industry more flexible to change\n- **American mass production**\n\t- Driven by civil war of 1850s\n\t- Used machinery to make parts\n\t\t- High production and great quality + accuracy\n\t- US marketed their watches better than other nations\n- **Swiss Response to the US**\n\t- Swiss reacted to US much better than Britain did to the Swiss\n\t- Swiss stressed the quality of their pieces, which were better than the US\n\t- Marketed itself with a Swiss prestige\n\t- After this the US industry fell away\n\t- The Swiss became crazy dominant in the watch market\n- **Quartz Watches**\n\t- USA and Japan benefitted from this\n\t\t- Timex, Seiko, Casio\n\t\t- US did mass production right with Quartz watches\n\t- Swiss lacked the technological ability to compete\n\t\t- They stuck to the high quality, good prestige mechanical watches\n\t- Quartz kept better time than a lot of more expensive watches\n\t- Swiss lost a lot of market share as a result of not doing well with Quartz\n\t- Swiss are still untouchable in the prestige market\n\n"},{"id":"superforecasting","title":"Superforecasting","author":"Phillip Tetlock","date":"2022-04-18","stars":"4","isbn":"9781847947154","content":"\n## Philosophical Outlook\n- **Cautious** - Accept nothing is certain and some things are just random\n- **Humble** - Reality is infinitely complex\n- **Nondeterministic** \n\t- What happens is not meant to be and does not have to happen\n\t- Determinism --> \"meant to be\" --> Hindsight bias --> Wrong probability --> Bad forecasts\n\t- Can avoid this by imagining the counterfactual that could have occurred\n- **“Need for cognition”** - Intellectually curious, enjoy puzzles and mental challenges\n\n## Thinking Styles\n- **Perpetual beta**\n\t*Most important characteristic found in superforecasters is belief updating & self improvement*\n\t1.

It talks about how they occur at the intersection of randomness and uniformity, making them definitively different from a random process. Gell-Mann goes on to explain how complex adaptive systems perform best at this intersection of uncertainty and regularity, and then gives some examples of these systems in the real world. \n\nThe second section goes into fundamental Physics, which is a subject in which Gell-Mann won a nobel prize. This section is a lot like a primer of particle physics as it relates to the other topics Gell-Mann mentions. If you're after a more complete primer of Physics as a discipline, I'd recommend [The Character of Physical Law](https://barneynapier.github.io/#/book/the-character-of-physical-law) by Feynman. It has a lot in common with this section. \n\nGell-Mann finishes off by bringing the first two sections together to see how complex adaptive systems perform in the real world. The focus is on Darwinian evolution, but he goes into more modern day applications of the same idea too. For example genetic machine learning algorithms (which at the time of publication must have been right at the forefront of statistical modelling).\n\n## Complex Adaptive Systems\n\n### Complex adaptive system (p25)\n1. Acuire information about environment\n2. Identify regularities\n3. Construct schema (model of the environment)\n4. Act based on that schema\n5. Reselect based on consequences (competition among schema)\n\n### Complexity\n- **Coarse graining**\n    - You need to specify a level of detail when describing a system\n    - When you do not go as detailed as possible you are using \"coarse graining\"\n    - Eg. Coarse grain from particles to atoms, atoms to objects\n- Context dependence - Any definition of complexity will be context dependent\n- Definitions of complexity\n    - Crude complexity = Length of shortest message that will describe a system\n    - **Algorithmic information content (AIC)** = Length of a computer program that will print out the system description then halt\n    - Compressability = How much you can compress a string of bits (eg 1010101010 is just 10 done 5 times)\n\n### Randomness\n- Definitions\n    1. No rule to compress its description\n    2. Generated by a random process\n    3. Generated by a mathematical formula so complex it is basically random (\"pseudo-random\")\n\n### Complexity != Randomness\n- Consider a string of random integers - Very random, not complex at all\n- **Complexity comes from a balance of randomness and non-randomness**\n- Current definitions only really measure randomness\n- The difference between randomness and complexity requires \"Effective complexity\"\n- **Effective complexity** = Len(schema) used by a CAS in the system\n    - Highest at the intersection of randomness and non-randomness\n    - EC plotted vs AIC looks like a pyramid\n    - AIC ~ regular + irregular\n    - EC ~ regular * irregular\n\n### Example CAS\n- **Child learning a language**\n    - Schema = Grammar\n    - So in this case, effective complexity would be the length of the grammar textbook (makes sense)\n- **Bacteria developing drug resistance**\n    - Schema = Genotype\n    - The CAS is the whole population of bacteria, not just one\n    - Genotype = regular / mutation = random\n    - Direct adaption = Chemically changing in reaction to a drug as opposed to by evolutionary survival\n- **The human scientific enterprise**\n    - Schema = Theory\n    - Optimisation of theory = Minimise complexity of schema subject to agreeing with observation\n    - Theories should be falsifiable (Karl Popper)\n    - Unifying theories greatly compress ideas from multiple fields into one set of equations (eg. General relativity, electromagnetism)\n\n### Theory\n- **Power law** distributions\n    - **Scale independent** (can multiply all ranks by a factor and nothing changes)\n    - \"Self organised criticality\" - Piles of sand example\n- Depth =~ Time to decompress a schema into the full description\n- Crypticity =~ Time for a computer to find the program that compresses the description into a schema\n\n### Fundamentals\n- Levels of science: Maths -> Physics -> Chemistry -> Biology -> Social Science\n- **A** is more fundamental than **B** if:\n    1. Laws of A can explain phenomena of B\n    2. Laws of A are more general than that of B\n- Eg. Quantum Electrodynamics is more fundamental than chemistry\n- **Reductionism** = Explaining the less fundamental in terms of the more fundamental\n- Lowest level not always best: You cannot understand psychology by knowing the chemistry of the brain\n\n## Fundamental Physics\n*Any fundamental force must be associated with an elementary particle that is the quantum of the corresponding field*\n\n### The Quantum Approach\n- Classical physics is only an approximation\n- Quantum state = Description of the probability distribution of position and momentum of all particles in the universe\n- Quantum Mechanics =~ Gravitational fields + electromagnetic fields + conservation of main quantities (energy, charge, ..)\n- Alternative histories / **decoherence**\n    - Traditional probabilities (between 0 and 1) require history to be sufficiently coarse grained\n    - Alternative histories are actually entangled when there is not enough interference \n    - D = decoherence functional\n    - Coarse graining allows histories to decohere into independent probailities as the quantum entanglement/interference nets out among the particles\n    - This is why the single electron slit experiment can be in 2 places at once, there is no decoherence to stop it. In this situation probabilities break down\n\n### Quarks & the Standard Model\n- Quantum Field Theory\n    - Quantum Electrodynamics = Transmission of photons between electrons\n    - Quantum Chromodynamics (strong nuclear force) = Transmission of gluons between quarks\n    - (?) Weak force = Electrons turning into electron neutrinos upon transmission of a charged quanta with a quark\n- Quarks\n    - Held together by QCD\n    - Charge: up (+2/3), down (-1/3)\n    - Color: One each from red, green and blue\n        - Driver of the strong force\n        - Gluons concerned with color - red-blue, blue-green, green-red gluons\n- Fermion families\n    1. Electron & neutrino, up & down quarks\n    2. Muon & neutrino, charmed (+2/3) & strange (-1/3) quarks\n    3. Tauon & neutrino, top (+2/3) and bottom (-1/3) quarks\n- Symmetry\n    - Time\n    - Matter/antimatter\n    - Spin (elementary fermions have spin 1/2, quanta have spin 1). Higgs boson only 0 spin particle\n\n### Arrows of time\n1. **Radiative arrow**: Energy radiates outward as time passes, never inward\n2. **Records arrow**: The creation of memories, and organisation of information\n3. **Cosmological arrow**: vThe universe is expanding\n4. **Thermodynamic arrow**\n    - 2nd Law of Thermodynamics = Entropc of a closed system does not decrease\n    - Over time systems tend toward disorder (Entropy)\n    - Because disorder is so probable\n    - The initial condition of the universe was the most organised\n    - Maxwells demon\n        - Organising hot/cold particles across a divide\n        - The demon himself must gain Entropy if the rest of the system loses it\n        - Comes from \"shredding\", the need to delete information in order to make space for organisation\n- Universe trending toward higher maximum complexity (potential, not effective)\n\n## Evolution & Selection\n\n### Fitness\n- Evolutionary drive toward higher complexity\n    - Diffusion from random walk of nature\n    - Amplified by gateway events\n- Markets and evolution\n    - Both CASs that adapt to inefficiencies\n    - They fill niches in the system\n- Fitness landscapes\n    - Getting to the lowest point on the fitness landscape = Stochastic Gradient Descent\n    - Inclusive fitness\n\n### Characteristics of Creative Thinking\n- Disregarding a previously held belief\n- Steps of breakthrough\n    1. **Saturation** = Work hard and intensely on a problem, filling the mind with all the difficulties\n    2. **Incubation** = Carry the problem around with you, thinking it over\n    3. **Illumination** = The eureka moment, you are doing something else then the solution comes to you\n- Escaping into a deeper basin on the fitness landscape --> **Introduce randomness**\n- Creative characteristics\n    - Dedication to the task\n    - Awareness of being trapped in an unsuitable basin\n    - Degree of comfort with teetering on the edge of basins\n    - Capacity to formulate and solve problems\n\n### Superstition\n- Pattern recognition\n    - **Superstition** = Seeing a pattern in randomness\n    - **Skepticism** = Not seeing a pattern where there is one\n\n### Maladaption\n- Why do some schemata adapt to be worse/in a bad way?\n- 3 types of adaption\n    1. **Direct adaption** = Reacting to the environment, you adapt to fire by not touching it\n    2. **Changing schema** = Updating the geneaology in the case of evolution\n    3. **Death** = The exctinction of a species\n- Schema adapt to the wrong thing (looking at the wrong features)\n- External influences impact the schema adaption (often humans)\n- Schemata may be adapting, just doing so slowly\n\n### Machine Learning\n- Learning: Neural nets, genetic algorithms\n- Simulation: Evolution, ecologies, economies\n- Economics as a CAS\n    - Economics ~ Study of incentives\n    - Uses agent based mathematics (more discrete than continuous)\n    - Economic agents are CASs with schemata\n    - They have bounded rationality and imperfect information\n    - Act based on chance and economic interest"},{"id":"everything-is-fucked","title":"Everything Is Fucked","author":"Mark Manson","date":"2021-09-18","stars":"4","isbn":"9780062888464","content":"\nAs humans we aim for Happiness. The opposite of happiness is not anger or sadness, its hopelessness and meaninglessness. So humans need hope and meaning. We need 3 things for this: (a) A sense of control, (b) a belief in the value of something, and (c) a community. A healthy sense of control means understanding that our feeling brain drives our actions, and instead learning to see our emotions more objectively through our thinking brain, instead of controlling them. A belief in the value of something comes from the narratives we tell ourselves about past and future experiences. And a community comes from sharing values with others and having them support our ideals. The modern world has begun to deprive us of these three things, hence why \"everything is fucked\". In theory people should mature from pleasure based values to transactional values to abstract values. Yet many get stuck holding transactional values because they value nothing above themselves. This can be solved through Kant's formula for humanity, which says we should treat all humans (including ourselves) as an end, and not merely a means. Finally, modern society has got so good at improving the pain people feel that we are now at a stage where we are eliminating it. As a result we have become addicted to comfort and pleasure, losing sight of better values in the process. \n\n## Hope\n\n### The Uncomfortable Truth\nOne day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will ever matter.\n\n### To maintain and build hope, we need 3 things\n1. A sense of control\n2. A beleif in the value of something\n3. A community\n\n### 1. A Sense of Control\n- The two brains\n\t1. Thinking brain\n\t2. Feeling brain\n- The **classic assumption** is that our thinking brain is in control of our actions\n- In reality our feelings control our actions, and our thinking brain rationalises narratives for the way we feel (and hence act)\n- \"The thinking brain makes shit up that the feeling brain wants to hear\"\n- Deny feeling brain --> numbed to the world, struggling to form meaningful relationships\n- Deny thinking brain --> impulsive and selfish\n- Self control is an illusion: Self control --> Self acceptance\n- Thinking brain should simply check in on how the feeling brain is doing\n- Recognising that your feeling brain could be wrong, and acting accordingly is the key to **emotional regulation**\n- The feeling brain controls feelings and impulses, but the thinking brain controls the **meaning** of those feelings\n\n### 2. A Belief in the Value of Something\n- Newtons 3 laws of emotion\n\t1. Every action has an equal and opposite emotional reaction\n\t\t- **Moral gaps**\n\t\t\t- Difference between what happened and what is deserved\n\t\t\t- Call for **equalisation** (punishment, reaction, pain, debt)\n\t\t\t- Moral gaps require us to determine some things as better than others\n\t\t\t- Hence our value hierarchies determine the moral gaps we seek to equalise\n\t\t-\"The more insecure you are about something the more you flap back and forth between delisuional feelings of superiority (I'm the best) and delusional feelings of inferiority (I suck)\"\n\t2. Our self worth equals the sum of our emotions over time\n\t\t- Our identity is emotionally created not logically created\n\t\t- Our values are stories we tell ourselves about experiences we have had in the past\n\t\t\t- Feeling brain feels something --> Thinking brain constructs a narrative to explain it --> We build up a network of these narratives --> This becomes our identity\n\t3. Your identity will remain your identity until an external force acts against it\n\t\t\t- Hence the only way to change our values is\n\t\t\t\t1. Re-examine past experiences and re-write the narratives around them\n\t\t\t\t2. Write narratives you want to live by then go out and follow them (ie. Have experiences contrary to your current values)\n\n### 3. A Community\n> Having others around us who share our values and support our ideals\n- This was the \"how to start your own religion\" chapter (not the best part of the book)\n- Pain is common\n- **God value**\n\t- The value at the top of the hierarchy is the lens through which you see all other values\n\n### Nietzsche's Moralities\n1. **Master morality** - Beleives in virtue of strength and dominance\n2. **Slave morality**- Beleives in virtue of  sacrifice and submission\n\n## Everything is Fucked\n\n### Maturity\n- Kohlberg's stages of moral development\n\t1. Children: Avoid pain and pursue pleasure\n\t2. Adolescents: Transactional values, I'll suffer pain if you give me pleasure\n\t3. Adults: Do things because they are right, not expecting anything in return\n\n### Kant's Formula for Humanity\n\n> \"Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means\"\n\n- Things we treat as means are interacted with conditionally\n- Unconditional action comes from treating things as an end (being an adult)\n\n### Pain as the Constant\n- **Blue Dot Effect** / rule of 7\n\t- In the experiment, participants expected to see blue dots about half the time, so they projected that onto the experiment\n\t- Same happens with stress/happiness/feelings\n\t- We expect life to have a certain level of happiness and in the long term we always revert to this (rule of7)\n\t- We also amplify/dampen our emotional reactions to stress so that it meets our expectations\n- Trying to eliminate pain just backfires, we see the little things in our lives as so much bigger because theres nothing else to cause us pain (and we expect a certain amount)\n- Pain is the universal constant. It will always be there. Key is choosing the pain\n- Avoiding pain --> Fragile\n- Choosing pain and accepting it --> Anti-fragile\n- Pain = Value\n\t- The amount we are willing to suffer for something defines how much we value it\n\n### Marketing to Feelings\n- Edward Bernays\n\t- Edward Bernays literally invented marketing to the emotions\n\t- He started in 1920s america, marketing cigarettes to women as a symbol of protest and independence\n\t- The whole of marketing is based around:\n\t\t1. Highlight, heighten and needle at peoples shame and insecurity\n\t\t2. Tell them your product will rid them of that shame and insecurity\n- Modern western economy --> Developed --> Instead of choosing different pain we can afford to avoid pain --> We get addicted to comfort and pleasure --> Our values diminish accordingly, now we care about instagram filters and makeup as opposed to life experience and connection\n- Fake vs real freedom\n\t- Fake freedom puts us on the hedonic treadmill\n\t- Real freedom involves limitation (\"what am I willing to give up\").

servants\n- Servants not as low as slaves\n- Slave revolution was a constant threat for slave masters\n- South and north depended on slavery to different degrees\n\t- The south had plantations and

If you're unsure if you want to give the whole book a read (it is a hefty tome), then start with that. \n\nThe speech summarises the idea of the whole book, namely,  using the one shot you get at life to make significant contributions to humanity. It emphasises a style of thinking more than a boilerplate approach. It uses example from various areas of his career in scientific research to hammer home the points, and some of that can get quite technical. But as Hamming mentions at the start, they are anciliary to the main idea of the book, so no need to get too bogged down in the maths if you don't want to. It's simply a way of showing how some the great minds he encountered approach problems.\n\nA final note that is important, dont try to internalise all the ideas of the book. Some will work for you, and others wont. Research and problem solving is a fundamentally personal activity, so see what resonates with you and build on that. \n\n---\n\n# Style of Thinking\n\n## Innovation\n\n### Thinking about the future\n- Questions for the future\n  - What is possible\n  - What is likely to happen\n  - What is desirable to happen\n- How will the future be different from now?\n- How will it be the same?\n- Think about the future to anticipate change (passive to active)\n\n### Thinking about new technologies\n- When you encounter a new technology, think in what new areas and ways can it be used? How will this be used in the future?\n- Always thinking of related concepts - how can this be applied elsewhere?\n- \"What are the real world uses of this idea?\"\n\n### Affecting change\n- If you do not occasionally doubt accepted rules, you will not be a leader\n- Sometimes things that are technologically feasible and economically desirable are prevented for political, social and legal reasons\n- Innovation in a field usually comes from an external source/individual\n\n## Independent Thought\n- \"Believe nothing, no matter where it comes from, unless it agrees with your own sense of logic and common sense\"\n- See a technology - have a hypothesis - think of an experiment to test the hypothesis\n- Take a lot of time to **think** - come up with opinions, theories and hypotheses\n- Think about something until \"you are fairly clear what you believe and why you believe it\"\n- Do your own work instead of spending all your time in lectures\n- Make time to turn ideas over in the mind\n- Do not just drift along, think of what you want to be and how to get there\n- Have theories on lots of things\n- If you look around your organisation there are many things that should not happen but do because they are customary \n- Develop the ability to quickly learn new fields\n\n## Working Diligently\n- Software chapter - Have care and diligence, think before you write code\n- Prove all of your assumptions, this way you\n  1. Don't make bad ones\n  2. Have a deep idea of what is going on\n  - Am I satisfied this is correct? \n- Do the proofs yourself\n- How will you convince yourself that you have not made a mistake somewhere\n- Question your assumptions: \"Why do I believe whatever I believe?\"\n- Working calmly gives you longevity, but the breakthroughs come after frustration and emotional struggle\n\n## Problem Solving\n\n### The problem\n- Be very clear on what the problem is\n- Complex idea --> what does it look like?\n- How does this fit into the whole picture?\n- When thinking of complex systems --> is it stable?\n- Think of how a system converges or diverges\n- Don't just think what a function is, what **class** is it from? What functions are similar to it? \n\n### Your toolbox\n- Multidisciplinary (all the sciences)\n- Awareness of cognitive biases\n- Have a broad scientific/mathematical toolbox from which to draw\n- \"How can other subject areas apply here?\"\n- A key skill in mathematics is abstract pattern recognition\n- The lab and the field are two very different things\n- Mathematics requires application to be useful\n- Prepare your mind for the future, do not just memorise, but truly understand things\n- Be aware of the limitations of certain measures and methods\n- Flexibility should be a part of modern systems and processes\n- Different skills matter at different levels in a field\n\n### Techniques\n- Start simple and build from there\n- Always start from the basics and build up from there\n- Back of the envelope calculations\n  - Retain information better\n  - Keep sharp the ability to model situations\n\n### Fundamentals\n- Focus on these\n- They:\n  - Have stood the test of time\n  - Can derive the rest of the field\n- If you know the fundamentals well, the fancy parts follow easily\n\n## Working with Others\n- Understands that most others don't think like him\n- Teamwork is a necessity when working on complex projects - know and understand that others have different views to you\n\n## Great Work\n- There is no shortage of opportunities to do great things.

Fear will never go away, as long as I continue to grow\n2. The only way to get rid of the fear of something is to do it\n3. The only way to feel better about yourself is to go out and do it\n4. Not only will I experience fear when in unfarmiliar territory, but so will everybody else\n5. Pushing through fear is less frightening than the underlying fear that comes from a feeling of helplessness\n\n## Reframing Fear\n- The issue is not fear itself, its how we view fear\n- Take control of your fear\n- Fear --> Power\n- Reframing fear to power is about changing your Locus of Control\n- Reframe\n\t- I cant -> I choose not to\n\t- Should -> Could\n\t- Problem -> Opportunity\n\t- If only -> Next time\n- Take the power back from fear\n\n## Taking Responsibility\n> Take responsibility for your own life\n- **Do not blame**: Either yourself or other things\n- Do not blame fear for not being able to do something, its your responsibility\n- If you want something --> Go and get it\n\n## Positive Thinking\n- Good habit to get into\n- Stop feeding yourself negative thoughts\n- Repeatedly feed yourself positive thoughts\n- Key: Know that you can lead a meaningful life regardless of your circumstances\n- Requires *regular practise* to form a habit\n\n## Friends and Relationships\n- Other people will imprint on you their attitudes\n- As you grow, the people you want to be around will change\n- Find a group of friends that are in the process of growing and developing\n- Avoid negative people\n- You must make the concious effort to create the friend group that is best for you\n- Often this is as simple as:\n\t- *\"I love you but I have to live my own life\"*\n\n## Being Happy with Decisions\n- Approach mistakes as learning opportunities\n- Win/Lose --> Win/Learn\n- Dont look at choices as right/wrong, just as **different**\n- Finding out what you dont like is just as beneficial as finding out what you do like\n- View life as a path of experiences, neither right nor wrong, either way you experience something\n- Take total responsibility for the outcome of your decisions\n\n## Keeping Perspective on Whats Important\n- Unhealthy to see anything as your \"whole life\" (eg.

Shallow work is like being a human spreadsheet, it's easy to automate. Deep work on the other hand, is more productive and adds more value to the world. It cannot be automated and involves more creative output. Most importantly, Newport tells us that deep work is a skill you can learn. By focusing on creating rituals that promote deep work, we can focus more without working harder. \n\n\n## 3 Beneficiaries Of The Rise Of Complex Technology Systems\n1. High skilled workers that can work intelligently with and leverage complex machines\n2. Superstars who are the best at what they do and can work from anywhere\n3. Investors with capital who put money into growing companies benefiting from tech (venture capitalists)\n\n## Determinants of Success in the Modern World\n1. Learn fast\n2. Produce high quality work fast\n\t- Deep work helps with the above massively\n\n> High quality output = time x focus \n\n## Deep Work Is Rare. Why? \n- Principle of least resistance, which says people do what is easiest in the moment, which is not deep work\n- \"Metric black whole\": you can't easily quantify the value of deep work, so it's easier to dismiss\n- Technopoly + internet centrism: the whole world thinks you're a dinosaur if you're not all for social media\n\n## Deep Work Leads To A Life Well Lived:\n- People prefer working hard at something to relaxing (book - \"Flow - The Psychology of Optimal Experience\")\n- Focusing on the right things is beneficial to you (book - \"wrapped\")\n- There's a philosophical wholesomeness to focussing on a trade, be it blacksmithing or programming \n\nHow to adopt deep work:\n- Work deeply (no shit)\n- Willpower depletion means simply trying to focus on deep work isn't enough, you need to **cultivate routines** that optimise you for deep work\n\n## Making Time For Deep Work\n\nWe can make time for deep work in different ways, which depend on how your lifestyle changes to include deep work. Such as:\n\n1. **Monastic** - remove all shallow work from life\n2. **Bi-modal** - allocate specific chunks of time to deep work, otherwise live life normally (generally at least 1 day chunks)\n3. **Rhythmic** - getting into a daily routine of hours not days \n4. **Journalistic** - Do deep work wherever you find the time \n\n## Getting Better At Deep Work\n\n### Cultivating Deep Work\n- Rituals: Routine that enables deep work\n- Grand gestures, eg JK Rowling moving into a hotel\n- Work with others (have time to collaborate, but still maintain deep work)\n\n### 4 Rules Of Execution\n1. Focus on the few most important things, not loads of things \n2. Focus on what you can control\n3. Keep a public \"scoreboard\"\n4. Maintain regular [accountability](https://barneynapier.github.io/#/post/accountability)\n\n### Downtime\n- Attention restoration theory & attention fatigue suggest that downtime allows you to rest to focus more later\n- When you're done with work, be done. Don't finish your day with half complete tasks, it leads to the [\"zeigarnik effect\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect)\n\n### Practise\n- Deep focus and mental ability is cultivated with repeated training\n- on the flip side, constant attention switching and giving in to distractions has a lasting negative impact on the brain (always multitasking means you can't recognise distractions and you're always distracted), you become addicted to distractions\n- Deep work requires training to 1) Be better at deep work 2) remove addiction to distractions \n\nDistractions are like unhealthy food. You don't take breaks from unhealthy food for a diet, you break from your diet to eat unhealthy food. Do the same between deep work and distractions (ie take breaks from focus for distraction by scheduling time to let distractions in)\n\n### Work Intensely\n- Theodore Roosevelt didn't study much at Harvard. But when he did, he went all-in on being focussed on it\n\n### Quit Social Media\n- Think about your high level goals\n- Does social media help with these\n- Using downtime to look at social media practises being distracted\n- Dont just think \"does this give me benefit\", but \"does this give me more benefit than it costs me\"\n\n### Day Within A Day\n- You work in the middle of the day\n- Treat your non work time as a day within a day\n\n### Remove Shallow Work\n- Basecamp and the 4 day work week\n- Do the bare minimum shallow work required, but no more\n\n### Schedule Every Minute Of Your Day\n- When on autopilot we don't track how we use our time well\n- This allows shallow work to creep into the day more than we allow\n\n### Say \"No\" Well\n- Be vague in your reason so people can't try to find a way to fit in\n- Have a limit on how much shallow work you do, and say no to all else\n\n### Limit Your Working Time\n- People often think they need longer than they do for work\n- Parkinson's law\n- Deep work benefits from a little pressure\n\n\n\n"},{"id":"the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fuck","title":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck","author":"Mark Manson","date":"2020-09-28","stars":"5","isbn":"9781760558772","content":"\nThis is a really good book that essentially says we should find values in our lives that we see as more important than our own suffering.

However, it's obviously a very personal process so Manson does well not to put too much emphasis on what you should think.\n\nFinally, he has an entire website of articles too. This book is actually made up of a lot of the articles he had written over the years, but there's a lot more great content on there that relates to this book and his others.

Read **Like a Story**\n2.  Read **Multiple Accounts**: History is biased, you must read more than one account of a period to understand it\n3.

Getting help during an attack), you must be specific - Tell a specific person to do a specific thing\n- Avoiding the trap\n  - Look for fake instances of social proof so you know when to get off autopilot\n  - Look out for the crowd acting foolishly, there is a good chance they know no more than you do\n\n## Liking\n- People like\n  - Physical attractiveness\n  - Those similar to themselves\n  - Compliments\n  - Cooperation (people you have cooperated with)\n- Watch out for people who are suspiciously similar to you\n- In order to produce liking, cooperation should not be unpleasant\n- You and others form an opinion of you based on what you are associated with\n  - Hence why we try hard to make public good associations and to hide bad ones (works both ways)\n- Watch out for times you seem to like people too much / too quickly\n- Association --> Food\n\n## Authority\n- We are unable to defy authority\n- We obey automatically, not considering the pros/cons\n- The **appearance of authority is enough**:\n  \ta. Titles - MD, Dr\n  \tb. Clothes - Uniform, suit etc\n  \tc.

He was known as 'the great explainer' for a reason. This book is taken from a lecture series he did at Cornell university. And true to his nickname, he explains each concept brilliantly. \n\nEach idea is explained conceptually and in a way that makes sense to the layman. It's not mathematical at all. In fact I would say this is one of the best top-down primers to the subject of Physics that you can get. \n\nMy notes are below, but honestly, it isn't a long book and you'd do much better to get the explanations from Feynman than you would from my second hand interpretations.\n\n## Introduction\n- Feynman was against formalisms\n- He treated life like a big game\n- The role of **symmetry** and **conservation** are present throughout the book\n- He discovered a physical law regarding the weak force\n\n## The Law Of Gravitation\n- Gravitation is described by 2 equations\n      1. F = G(mm'/r2)\n      2. F = ma\n- **Kepler's** laws:\n      1. Orbits follow an ellipsis\n      2. Area between two radial vectors is always equal over the same stretch of time\n      3. Time to complete an orbit is proportional to (size of orbit)3/2\n- Physical laws allow us to discover new laws\n- Einstein made changes to Newton's laws to account for **relativity**\n- The law of gravitation does not apply on the **quantum scale** - there is no strong theory of quantum gravity\n- Physical laws are:\n      1. Mathematical in expression\n      2. Not exact\n      3. Simple, hence they apply widely\n- Stars are formed by gaseous blobs of dust grouping together thanks to gravity\n\n## The Relation Of Mathematics To Physics\n- Maths allows us to explain how things work, not why\n- Physics is inefficient in the sense that it does not build up from fundamental axioms like maths does\n- There are many ways to look at and think about the same theory\n      1. Newtons law\n      2. Local field theorem\n      3. Minimum principle\n- Mathematics is very generalist (eg. For n dimensions) whereas physics is applied (eg. N=3 dimensions)\n\n## The Great Conservation Principles\n- Almost all physical laws have the conservation laws in common\n- These laws allow physicists too discover new particles/laws by assuming the conservation laws hold\n- Conservation of energy can explain most of the other conservation laws\n- How does the theory of relativity impact the conservation principles? - pp65\n\n## Symmetry In Physical Law\n- Defn: Changes which have **no effect** on the physical laws\n- Symmetry and conservation laws are interlinked\n\nWorking symmetries:\n    1. Translation in space\n    2. Translation in time\n    3. Rotation in space\n    4. Relativity (uniform velocity in a straight line)\n\nNot working symmetries:\n    1. Change in scale (minimum limit due to particles)\n    2. Change in angular speed\n    3. Reflection in space\n\n- Electrons exit a beta decay spinning to the **left**\n- The world is not symmetrical if right and left are not the same - reflection in space does not work\n\n## The Disctinction Of Past And Future\nOn a fundamental level, all physical laws should work when time is moving backward. Take the coloured water example:\n- Even though light blue water would look weird splitting back up into clear and blue, it wouldn't look weird if a blue atom collided with a white one (it would look the same as if you played it forward)\n- A collision is random, so will look the same going backward\n- The water does not split back up into blue and clear, but it is not impossible, just highly unlikely\n\nWe have also reason to believe that Beta decay may not be time sensitive either. \n\nFinally a fun side note. 7.82m volts = an energy level in carbon. If this energy level did not exist then we would not have more than half the elements in the periodic table (nb: what is an energy level?)\n\n## Probability And Uncertainty\nThis chapter relates to the quantum mechanical view of nature\n- **Particles** - Discrete, experience no interference (\"bullets\")\n- **Waves** - Continuous, experience interference\n- Electrons are discrete, but experience interference unless you observe them by exposing them to light\n\nWave particle duality is best explained by the double-slit experiment (shout-out to my A level physics teacher Mr Rice)\n- There are two particles which have this feature\n      1. Light (photons)\n      2. Electrons\n- The probability of arrival of the electrons is distributed like the intensity of a wave\n- In this experiment, there is no way of predicting which hole the electron will pass through\n\n## Seeking New Laws\n- Particles explain most phenomena (at low energy)\n- If you combine all known laws of physics then you break some equations (things = infinity or divide by 0 etc) and so we know that they are missing something / something is wrong\n- To get new laws:\n      1. Guess\n      2. Compute results\n      3. Compare to the experiment\n- Most phenomena can be explained by:\n    1. Electrons\n    2. Photons\n    3. Gravitons\n    4. Neutrinos\n    5. Protons\n    6. Neutrons\n    7. ... And their anti particles\n- Sometimes, when looking for new laws you have to choose some of the existing laws to drop\n- Any good physicist knows multple theories for the same thing"},{"id":"autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin","title":"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin","author":"Benjamin Franklin","date":"2019-03-28","stars":"4","isbn":"9781435119895","content":"\nThis book has a lot of gold in it, but you've got to put in the work to go looking for it. The old fashioned english used and the fact there is no organisation to the book (it's just one long piece of text) make it among the harder books to read. Especially at the start as you are just getting used to the language. \n\nThat being said, you'll be glad you read it when youre done. But if you still can't be arsed to read it. Take a look at my thoughts below. \n\n## Main Ideas\n\nBe a **good judge of character**. This way you can test who is worth your time and who is not\n\nBe **good to people**. Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it will help you in the future too.\n\n**Spend your time wisely**. What you do on a daily basis impacts the man you are in the future (--> The Power of Habit)\n\n**Spend time with the right people**. Actively spend time with people who are good for you (intelligent and impressive), while removing those who are bad for you.\n\n**Have a set of values**. He wrote that the two principles that will make a poor mans fortune are above all others probity (Having strong morals) and integrity. Live by them and let them guide you, it will give you the reputation of being a well principled person\n\n**Read and learn insatiably**\n\n## 13 Virtues\nFranklin created for himself 13 characteristics that he wanted to develop. He tracked each of these habits individually, noting with a dot in his journal when he did not adhere to them. He began with number 1, and only moved onto the next one only once he had completed an entire week of no dots.\n\n1. **Temperance**. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\n2. **Silence**. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\n3. **Order**. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\n4. **Resolution**. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\n5. **Frugality**. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.\n6. **Industry**. Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\n7. **Sincerity**. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.\n8. **Justice**. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.\n9. **Moderation**. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.\n10. **Cleanliness**. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.\n11. **Tranquillity**. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\n12. **Chastity**. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.\n13. **Humility**. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\n## Reading & Writing\n\nFranklin read voraciously, and noted a few books that he learned a lot from\n1. On human understanding (Locke) - Combined with the below book to learn thought/philosophy\n2. The art of thinking (Messrs, du port royal)\n3. Memorable things of socrates (Xenophon) - To learn the socratic method\n\nHe also believed that his autobiography (and biographies in general) build indirect experience of events and lives\n\n## Thought and Opinion\n- Shared knowledge is better than knowledge kept secret\n- He wrote many essays, learning how to write well from a young age by arguing with a pen pal\n- The change inflicted by his essays show the power of a well thought through argument\n- If you wish improvement of knowledge then hold your opinions and thoughts loosely\n- Formed the **Junto Club** to disscuss important matters with his intelligent friends\n  - Matters of philosophy, politics, morals etc\n  - Each meeting someone would write an essay which was to be discussed in the meetings\n\n## Relationships\n- Lent a lot of money to his friends, he often was not paid back\n- He built and added to his network of \"ingenious\" people whenever he met someone clever\n- He **sought out the intelligent and impressive people** wherever he went, not just waiting to stumble upon them\n- How people see you is important, so you should make sure that your reputation is going to do you favours (Act as if)\n- Not only did he seek out intelligent people, he also removed those who were bad for him in a ruthlessly critical manner.\n- He found that people respond better to suggestions when you present them on behalf of a group not an individual, this is how Franklin sold subscriptions to the library for the junto club\n- \"He that has done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another\"\n- He was always judging the character of other people, by doing this he became very good at it. Shows the benefits of a **strong judge of character**\n- Being a good person makes people want to be lead by you. The 13 virtues were Franklins way of building the character necessary not only to be able to lead, but to be wanted as a leader\n- In the back of your mind, always be thinking in one way or another \"how can I benefit others\"\n\n## Hard Work\n- Many people called him the hardest worker he knew\n- One of his principles was \"Industriousness\" which he valued incredibly highly\n- **Spend your time wisely**. Once the library in Philadelphia was up and running he made the choice every day to spend time there instead of in the tavern. Replacing the education he says he did not get in the formal sense\n- When the going gets tough, a lot of people change their original goal to save some work, Franklin says this is not something to make a habit of as it leads to worse work\n- Never reject a position because you feel you are inexperienced, only if it is against your virtues\n\n## Commendable Acheivements\n- Founding the **junto club**\n- Started the first library in Philadelphia\n- Conducted the experiments which proved lightning is just electricity (lightning rods)\n- Set up the \"Union Fire Company\", essentially the first fire brigade\n- Wrote a book on science experiments"},{"id":"the-prince","title":"The Prince","author":"Niccolo Machiavelli","date":"2019-02-16","stars":"4","isbn":"9781479420254","content":"%%\nPower\n%%\n\n\nBefore getting onto my notes, I'd like to say that whenever people ask me about Robert Greene's book \"The 48 Laws of Power\", I tell them to read this instead. It is an absolute classic on ruthless strategy and contains the majority of the ideas that Greene talks about. It's also the source he probably references the most in his book.\n\nNow onto the notes...\n\n> Approaches politics and power realistically, not idealistically. A Prince should do what is necessary to achieve power whether it is good or evil. Essentially a book of instructions on how to be a tyrant\n\nBefore breaking down the book, I took some general ideas from throughout which I've bullet pointed below. \n\nGeneral princely advice:\n- Any injury a prince does to a man should be so severe that he does not fear vengeance\n- Have foresight and implement countermeasures (especially in war, which should be ideally prevented)\n- Do not depend on others\n- Men must be either won over or destroyed\n- Cruelty used well does not persist, it is a necessary evil for the good of ones subjects and not a tool to be used too frequently\n- When inflicting injuries, do so in a \"once for all\" manner. Don't drag it out\n- The key is not to be hated\n- A prince should strive to do good, but know how to do evil if it is necessary\n- A prince will always have two main fears\n\t1. Internal subversion\n\t2. External attack\n\n## Principalities\n\n### Hereditary Principalities\n- Dismissed as easy to manage\n- The people are accustomed to the rule of the family already\n\n### Mixed / Composite Principalities\n- = An appendage to an existing state\n- Difficult to manage, as \n\t1. You are hated by those you conquer\n\t2. You have to integrate potentially different cultures/laws\n- Upon conquer, a prince must\n\t1. Destroy the old family\n\t2. Not change laws of taxes\n\t3. Settle within the Principality to keep his ear to the ground\n\t4. Befriend small neighbours by becoming their protector\n\t5. Weaken the power of stronger neighbours\n- States with more centralised power (eg Turks) are harder to conquer, but easier to maintain power over, than states with less centralised power (eg France)\n- How to administer states with their own laws, either:\n\t1. Devastate them\n\t2. Go and live there in person\n\t3. Let them keep their own laws\n\n### New Principalities\n1. Acquired by **own arms**\n\t- Acquired with difficulty \n\t\t- Did all work themself\n\t\t- Have to implement new laws and institutions\n\t- Maintained with ease - If youre good enough to take it youre good enough to keep it\n2. Acquired by **others arms** (fortune)\n\t- Acquired with ease - someone else does it\n\t- Maintained with difficulty - dependent on help of others\n3. Acquired by **crime**\n\t- May win a prince power but no glory\n4. Acquired by the **approval of fellow citizens** (\"constitution\")\n\t- When either the **people or the nobles** choose to increase the standing of one of their members to have more power as a group\n\t- People have more power than nobles in aggregate, they should be focussed on more\n\n## Military & Arms\n- Strength of a principality measured by its ability to stand alone (independence)\n- Troops a Prince can use\n\t1. **His own** - Good\n\t2. **Mercenaries** - Bad as they cannot be trusted\n\t3. **Another states** (auxiliary) - Worst, as you become dependent on another state (better to lose with your own forces than win thanks to someone elses)\n- The art of war\n\t- The number 1 job of a rules is military strategy\n\t- Preparation in times of peace to be ready in times of war\n\t\t- Prepare the **mind** with military strategy and knowledge of history\n\t\t- Prepare the **body** by growing accustomed to hardship\n\n## Qualities of a Prince\n- Good and bad qualities are not so clear cut\n- A prince should appear to have all the good qualities and none of the bad, but if it comes to it, he should embody the bad qualities insofar as it maintains his rule\n- Generosity is good, however it makes you poor - Miserliness is OK\n- Compassion is good, however it makes you appear a pushover - Cruelty keeps a state united and loyal\n- **Fear vs Love** - It is better to be feared than loved, but ideally both\n- A prince should honour his word, but if it is necessary to break this then he should\n- Avoiding hatred\n\t- At all costs, this leads to insurgence and loss of power\n\t- The people are key, dont make them hate you\n\n## Prudence of a Prince\n- Earn honour by\n\t1. Great campaigns & demonstrations of ability\n\t2. Revealing himself as a true friend or true enemy (being irresolute shows fear)\n\t3. Honour those who are talented and excel\n- Choosing ministers\n\t- Those who think always of the prince and not themselves\n\t- Make them dependent on you (removes insurgence)\n\t- Demand honesty \n\t\t- Do not tolerate flattery from ministers, it is not useful\n\t\t- Allow these to be the core people who can speak candidly to you\n\n## Fortune vs Freedom\n- He says it is \"fortune is the arbiter of about half the things\"\n- Men have certain characteristics, and policy sometimes calls for those characteristics --> You are fortunate if the current environment requires your characteristics and unfortunate if not"},{"id":"a-million-miles-in-a-thousand-years","title":"A Million Miles in a Thousand Years","author":"Donald Miller","date":"2019-02-14","stars":"5","isbn":"9781400202669","content":"\nThis is a great book to read when you are young.

It makes the book a pleasure to read too.\n\nA story is \"**a character who wants something and overcomes conflict to get it\"**\n\n### 1. Exposition\n- Life is boring compared to a movie\n- Because there is no story\n- A story is \"**a character who wants something and overcomes conflict to get it\"**\n- We can make our own stories for our lives\n- Life can be made more like a good story\n- He realised most of this while making a movie about himself in which he had to fake parts to make it more interesting\n\n### 2.

A Character Who Wants Something\n- We choose boring stories because it is easier\n- Good stories must be **forced**\n- You can force a good story using an **INCITING INCIDENT**\n  - An action that starts your story which you can't go back on\n  - Kicks the character out of the comfort zone and into a good story\n- \"Great stories go to those who don't give in to fear\"\n  - Fear will reduce you to a boring life\n- Good stories have **risk** (to get something you want)\n- They have bad moments too (makes you appreciate the good)\n- \"What do you want?\"\n- Easy stories bring no satisfaction\n- NB: We can't fully control our stories (There is a lot in the world that is out of our control)\n- Next leve stories need\n  - What the character wants must be **very difficult to obtain**\n  - The **ambition must be sacrificial** (character must go through pain and risk everything for it)\n- The stories we live mould our characters\n- Idea: Write down all your memories in a notebook like Bob\n\n### 4.

The Aprenticeship Of An Empirical Sceptic\n- Hindsight is dangerous because you consider onnly information that is relevent to the outcome, and neglect the rest\n\n### 2. Yevgenia'S Black Swan\n\n### 3. The Speculator And The Prostitute\n- Trading is scalable (same work for 1 share as 1000), prostitution is not (1 hours work, 1 hours pay\n- Black swans are only possible in extremiststan (contains non scalable qualities), not mediocristan (contains scalable qualities)\n\n### 4. 1001 Days / How Not To Be A Sucker\n- A black swan is a suckers problem. If you know it's coming it's not a black swan\n\n### 5. Conformationtion / The Error Of Confirmation\n- No evidence of black swans is VERY DIFFERENT from evidence of no black swans\n- Negative empiricism (looking for a black swan to prove all swans aren't white) is the way to further knowledge\n- Understanding how to act under situations of incomplete information is one of humanitys greatest pursuits\n- 2, 4, 6 - what is the rule?\n- Consider \"all swans are white\" Vs \"all non white objects are not swans\"\n\n### 6. Therrative Fallacy\n- Narratives organise information, and information is easier to store when organised, so even when it doesn't hold. We have a susceptability to narratives\n- Avoid the narrative fallacy by valuing experimentation over storytelling, and clinical knowledge over theories\n\n### 7. Livinge Antichamber Of Hope\n- Linear progression is not the norm, everything is non linear\n- Hedonic happiness - lots of small bits of good news are far better than one huge batch of great news (spread your happiness out)\n- You're either a turkey (don't see a black swan coming) or an anti-turkey (always preparing for a black swan)\n- You either bet in favour of a black swan (blowup) and bleed the process out with small losses until the big gain, or you bet against the black swan (blowup) and bleed huge losses when it occurs\n\n### 8. The Problem Of Silent Evidence\n- Problem of silent evidence - where are all the planes with shot hulls?\n- For it to be true that certain skills make a writer good, bad writers must not exhibit these skills, people often fail to check this\n- Think of criminals that get caught, we assume a general criminal identity from these ones but the ones that don't get caught are actually much more impressive\n- Decision makers like governments can usually reap the benefits and hide the costs it incurs on someone else. (Hurricane Katrina getting money than should go to cancer patients)\n- Silent evidence can lower the apparent risk of a situation\n\n### 9. The Lucid Fallacy/The Uncertainty Of The Nerd\n- Nerds think exceedingly inside the box like Dr John\n- Lucid fallacy = misuse of games to model real life situations\n  - Wrong because we can only model known uncertainty, not unknown uncertainty\n- Part 1 in a sentence. THE COSMETIC AND THE PLATONIC RISE NATURALLY TO THE SURFACE, WHILE THE UNCERTAIN HAS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BEING IGNORED\n\n## Part B: We Just Can't Predict\n\n### The Scandal Of Prediction\n- The confidence interval experiment proves we think we know more than we do\n- We always overestimate our knowledge and underestimate the likelihood of random events\n- If you provide someone with more information, they are likely to formulate more theories and formulate them too early (fire hydrant photo at different intervals)\n- Adding information does however make us more confident in our original theory (right or wrong)\n- Tunnelling refers to not considering unpredictable external events in your decision making\n- Scalability of randomness is the reason we suck at prediction\n- Accuracy of your forecast is far more valuable than the value itself - is there a high variance?\n- variance\n\n### 11. How To Look For Bird Poop\n- We usually fail to predict the impact (if any) inventions and discoveries have - discovery of penicillin by Alex Flemming wasn't predicted/planned\n- Prediction required knowledge of future tech/inventions, and if we had that knowledge those things would be invented by us right now\n- Platonic is top down, formulaic and closed minded\n- Hand washing was rejected in hospitals for years even though evidence showed it saved lives, simply because doctors couldn't explain it with a theory (it was beyond them that they may not have all knowledge)\n- The past can confirm 2 opposing theories at the same time (being closer to death or having a longer life expectancy if you survive today)\n- We have escaped evolution because we can project conjectures in our head instead of just doing it and seeing if we die\n\n### 12. Epistemocracy, A Dream\n- Epistemocrat is humble in his knowledge and always questions whether she is right, but is confident enough to say I don't know\n- Epistemocracy = a utopia with the central focus on ignorance, not knowledge\n- In predicting the effect decisions will have on our future, we tend to think they have a permanent one (in reality we adapt), and so we undergo positive decisions like buying a car too much and negative ones like taking risks too little\n- Randomness is true randomness, randomness that can be reverse engineered to a theory/equation is called chaos - chaos theory\n\n### 13. What To Do If You Cannot Predict\n- Humans have to pass judgement, we don't see a tree, we see a pretty tree. It's too much effort not to\n- For small insignificant things being human in prediction is fine, part of life in fact\n- Barbell strategy/Convexolio - having 80% risk free and 20% really risky, this exposes you to black swans positively. As opposed to a medium risk portfolio that doesn't account for black swans\n- How to use prediction\n  - Notice the difference between situations where black swans are positive (venture capital) and when they are negative (bank lending)\n  - Don't be narrow minded and don't try to predict black swans (be prepared, don't predict)\n  - Don't be an idiot and not expose yourself to positive black swans - live in a big city, go to parties, try to force those beneficial chance encounters\n  - Don't listen to people trying to forecast black swans / significant events\n- We don't know the probabilities of black swans but we can predict their effects (Eg an earthquake)\n\n## Part C: Those Grey Swans Of Extremistsan\n\n### 14. From Mediocristan To Extremistan And Back\n- Cumulative advantages are very present in scholarly work (think of picking 3 random scholars from 50 and quoting them, the butterfly effect will make them famous) - I quote you you quote me business\n- Luck/chance both made and unmade Rome. It has the great property of reshuffling societies cards every so often because basing worth on ability isn't 100% fair anyway\n- Extremistan has characteristics of the internet that can facilitate tiny niche markets that wouldn't survive in mediocristan\n\n### 15. The Bell Curve, That Great Intellectual Fraud\n- The bell curve says that the likelihood of outliers gets exponentially less likely as you move away from the average\n- Gaussian - Bell curve, the marginal decrease in probability of events rises as you move away from the mean\n- **A 20 sigma deviation is 1 trillion times more likely than a 21 sigma deviation** (now consider if that is down to measurement error)\n- Mandlebrotian/fractal - constant scalability/marginal change in probability\n- The rarer the event, the larger our error in estimating it's probability\n- Random walk theory backs up the bell curve as all results in the middle have been cancelled out (win £1 then lose £1)\n- \"Scaling to sigma\" - using sigma as a unit of measurement\n\n### 16. The Aesthetics Of Randomness\n- Recursive = can be applied to itself infinitely\n- Fractal ity is the repetition of geometric patterns as different scales (small rocks look like mountains, leaf veins look like branches etc)\n- The fractal power law is all well and good but it's still really hard to pick an actual power\n- Circularity of statistics - you need data to get a probability distribution but the probability distribution is what tells you how much data you need\n- Most models attempt to be predictive instead of descriptive\n- Affinity = share characteristics / from the same family\n- Fractal/mandlebrotian randomness helps turn black swans into gray swans because it considers their likelihood to be non zero (if you expect it it cannot be a black swan)\n- **If the stock market is Gaussian (bell curve) then the 1987 crash would happen once every few billion years**\n- People tend to confuse probability with regularity - if something occurs with probability 1 in 20 years you're fine if only exposed for 10 years (this is not true)\n- Skeptical empiricism = bottom up, platonicity = top down\n\n### 18. The Uncertainty Of The Phony\n\n### 19. How To Get Even With The Black Swan\n- Don't worry about known uncertainties, worry about unknown uncertainties\n- Aggressively expose yourself to positive black swans and conservatively hide from negative ones\n- **Missing a train is only painful if you run for it - this is the value of elegance**\n- You control your own actions so make this your end"},{"id":"misbehaviour-of-markets","title":"Misbehaviour of Markets","author":"Benoit Mandlebrot","date":"2018-12-04","stars":"4","isbn":"9780465043552","content":"\n## Key Points\n- Markets do not follow a normal distribution, they have fatter tails\n- Markets have long term memory and so are not independent of one and other\n- Market returns follow a power law\n- Mandlebrot invented the \"Multifractal model of asset returns\"\n\n## Risk, Ruin & Reward\n- Bachalier's model of markets\n\t1.

Market time is relative\n- Readers should be appreciative of new ways of looking at markets (in this case the fractal view)\n- Markets are fractal because by looking at a single chart you cannot tell if the chart covers 10 minutes or 10 years\n\n## By The Toss Of A Coin Or By The Flight Of An Arrow\n- **Stochastic** - Looking at financial markets through the lens of probability theory\n- Types of randomness\n\t1. **Mild (Gaussian)**\n\t\t- The tossing of a coin\n\t2. **Wild (Cauchy)**\n\t\t- A drunk archer who could shoot in any direction with equal power\n\t\t- Outliers have a significant impact (If he shoots sideways)\n- Financial models are build around mild randomness, whereas the markets behave in a more wild way\n\n## Bachalier And His Legacy\n- **Louis Bachalier** = First person to apply mathematical principles to the stock market\n- Viewed the price process as arithmetic \"brownian motion\"\n- Bachaliers views & papers lay dormant for many years until academics such as Samuelson and Fama picked it up and developed it roughly 50 years later\n- Mandlebrot argues that those who picked up on the work of Bachalier did not take the time to verify if the process of continuous brownian motion is an apt way to model the stock market\n\n## The House Of Modern Finance\n\n### Capital Asset Pricing Model\n1. Henry Sharpe\n2. Expected return is the risk free rate plus beta times the risk premium over the market\n\n### Modern Portfolio Theory\n1. Harry Markowitz\n2. Building mean-variance efficient portfolios\n3. Markowitz (in an interview separate from this book) has said that actually MPT does not depend on the normal distribution\n\n### Black Scholes Model\n- Fisher Black, Myron Scholes, Robert Merton\n- Pricing options\n\n## The Case Against Modern Theory Of Finance\nMandlebrot lists some assumptions which academic theories and models depend on\n1. Investors are rational\n2. Investors are homogenous\n3. \n4. Price changes are continuous\n5. Price changes follow a normal distribution (brownian motion)\n\nWhen errors to the CAPM model were found (eg the equity factors), instead of looking for a new model financiers made tweaks to the CAPM model --> Mandlebrot disagrees with this as the model is still fundamentally flawed\n\n## Turbulent Markets: A Preview\n\nWe can use market \"turblulence\" as a metric for price processes\n\nFinancial market charts share a lot of characteristics with those of \"turbulence\" in wind tunnels\n\n## Studies In Roughness: A Fractal Primer\n\nFractals can broken down into 3 steps:\n**1.** **Initiator** - Classic geometrical object (Straight line, triangle, spherical ball)\n**2.** **Generator** - A template from which the fractal will be made\n**3.** **Rule of recursion** - This decides the way the fractal is repeated\n- Introduces the \"fractal dimension\" of something\n- If you are measuring a fractal, for example we use a stock price line, with a ruler. If you start with the ruler being exactly the length of the line, then you reduce the length of the ruler and connect more rulers from start to end. As you continually reduce the length of the ruler the total length of all the rulers will increase, the ratio of the reduction in ruler length to the increase in total length is known as the **fractal dimension**. So a straight line has a fractal dimension of 1, whereas the british coastline has a fractal dimension of 1.25\n\n## The Mystery Of Cotton\n\nIf you plot a power law line on log-log paper, the gradient is the power\n\nThis chapter is all about Mandlebrot's discoveries in cotton prices and how they obey a **power law**\n\nThe main concepts are:\n  1. Power laws in finance (market returns)\n  2. Power laws in economics (Pareto's distribution of wealth)\n  3. Alpha stable distributions\n\n## Long Memory. From The Nile To The Marketplace\n\n- H.E Hurst was tasked with calculating how much water needed to be stored to prepare for droughts near the Nile\n- He discovered that although the rainfall followed a gaussian distribution (square root law), the range from the highest nile flood to the lowest nile flood followed a three fourths law (not gaussian)\n- This was found to be a **long memory process**\n- The ACF (auto correlation function) of the nile died down far too slowly to be considered stationary\n- Mandlebrot decided (following a chance conversation with a harvard professor) to take a look at financial markets and see if they too have long memory\n\nMandlebrot uses the long memory\n1. H = Coefficient of long memory in fractals\n2. H = 1/2 for a stationary process\n3. 1/2 < H < 1 for any persistent process\n4. H < 1/2 for a mean reverting process\n\n## Noah, Joseph And Market Bubbles\n\nMandlebrot's model is based on two parameters\n1. a (alpha) = Measure of scaling law (Noah)\n2. H = Measure of market long term memory (Joseph)\n\nBased on this, Mandlebrot says that market wildness can be characterised into 2 main parts, \"abrupt change\" and \"almost trends\" (The Noah and Joseph effects respectively)\n\nThere is an interplay between the two effects which causes many of the financial market bubbles that we see\n\n## The Multi-Fractal Nature Of Trading Time\n\nCombines two main facts below with trading time\n  1. Dependency\n  2. Discontinuity\n\nCombining these results in Mandlebrot's multifractal model\n\n**Multi-fractals**\n  1. Have more than one scaling ratio in the same object\n  2. \"Multi Fractal model of asset returns\"\n  3. Shows that on short time frames, prices vary wildly, but on long time frames they seem to settle down\n\n## Ten Heresies Of Finance\n\n1. Markets are turbulent - Characterised by scaling and long term dependence\n2. Markets are very very very risky - More than theories and models prepare for\n3. Market \"timing\" matters greatly - Market time is different to world time, most returns are made in small periods of time\n4. Prices often leap, not glide - They are not continuous\n5. In markets, time is flexible - Fractal analysis can be applied to any time scale as all market data is fractal\n6. Markets in all places and ages work alike\n7. Markets are inherently uncertain and bubbles are inevitable\n8. Markets are deceptive - Beware the issues of technical analysis\n9. Forecasting prices may be perilous, but you can estimate the odds of future volatility\n10. In financial markets, the idea of value has limited value\n\n## In The Lab\n\nA chapter highlighting some of the people that are approaching finance in a way that Mandlebrot is happy with, often using Fractals or accepting the power laws of the markets\n\nThese people include  1.

Both by Charles Duhigg. I'm not the only one that thinks so either. Ray Dalio gives everybody at Bridgewater a copy of this when they join the hedge fund. It's a very practical book, and much like The Power of Habit, it is really easy to read. But if you really don't want to read it, the appendix at the end of the book gives a good user's guide to the concepts I've made notes on below.\n\n## Motivation\n- Control\n    - Internalise your Locus of Control to feel more motivated. Take responsibility for actions and consequences\n    - Prove to yourself that you are in control of a situation. Eg: \"I can talk, but I only have 10 minutes\". You are controlling the time frame and hence will be more motivated for those 10 minutes because of it\n- Choice\n    - When we make choices (small or large, right or wrong), we feel more motivated to do the thing that we have chosen to do. Simply because we have chosen to do it\n    - If you don’t feel motivated, make the choice to take a small step of some sort in the right direction, this will likely spur you on to the next steps\n- Higher meaning\n    - Link what you are doing to a higher meaning/larger goal, this way we can keep going with something because despite not seeing immediate benefit, we continually remind ourselves why we are doing it\n    - Keep asking yourself why you are doing something, it will keep you linkning your actions to larger goals\n\n## Teams\n- Psychological safety\n    - Feeling intellectually safe in your team, so that you will say anything and put any ideas you think are good forward, knowing/believing that you will not receive judgement from the rest of the team. You feel safe to be your psychological self\n    - Ensure that everyone has equal voices\n    - Social sensitivity - Group empathy, people within the team are responsive to how others are acting and feeling, making them feel safe\n- Role of the leader\n    - Promote the actions mentioned above\n    - Ask the quiet ones what they think\n    - Make it clear your opinion will not always be right, so that people have the confidence to correct you\n\n## Focus\n- Cognitive Tunelling\n    - Focusing too much on what is directly in front of us, hence not using all available information\n    - Sort of like a visual availability bias\n- Mental models\n    - When you begin a task, have an idea of what you expect to see, this will keep you on the look out for things that are different to this model you have in your head\n    - Think of the mental models as a scaffolding/map through which we can pass the information that we see\n    - By forcing yourself to look at things through mental models you are more receptive to whether the thing deserves your time or not, you may choose to ignore it because it is not worth it\n\n## Goal Setting\n- SMART goals\n    - Specific, Measureable, Realistic, Acheivable, Realistic, Time sensitive\n    - Incorporates the steps needed to form a plan of how to achieve a goal\n- Stretch goals\n    - Spark big ambitions, this is a one liner that you write down and want to achieve, but you don’t yet know how\n- Combining Smart and Stretch\n    - Prevents you from making smart goals that are not big enough for your ambitions\n    - Ensures you have a plan for the big goals you want to achieve - Think now, plan later\n    - Write the stretch goal at the top of a page, then break it down into subgoals where you write the SMART components you are using to plan how to achieve the stretch goal\n- Long Term Goals\n\n## Managing Others\n- Commitment culture\n    - A culture in which the employees are committed to the company itself performs best\n- Agile management\n    - Putting decision making in the hands of those closest to the problem\n    - Think of the toyota plant with the wire above the workers, empowering them to pull it if they think something is not right\n    - This improves motivation and commitment to the company\n\n## Decision Making\n- The below points all suggest that decisions should be made using bayesian decision making, while collecting as much data as possible\n- Probabilistic thinking\n    - Envision many outcomes\n    - Use bayesian and conditional probability to calculate expected values\n    - Make decisions according to expected values, updating your views along the way as more data becomes available\n- Experience\n    - **Expose yourself to both successes and failures throughout your life to educate you in the world**\n    - Experience helps with estimating base rates\n    - Broad experiences = Better predictions\n- Base rates\n    - Keep a base rate in mind at all times\n    - Adjust your views from the base rate, be anchored to this\n    - Use bayesian updating to adjust your opinion\n- Envision multiple futures\n    - Weighted average of the futures, this should be the mindset\n\n## Innovation\n- Combine old ideas in new ways\n    - Derive innovation from historical innovation\n- Use your own real life experiences\n    - Meaning you need to go out and get some\n- Don’t get too fixed on one idea\n    - Avoid this by critiqing all the ideas you have\n    - Must be painfully honest\n    - Singlemindedness will cost you a lot of good ideas that you push away\n- Disruption is good for creativity\n    - Don’t be worried by a little stress/anxiety coming from all the chaos\n\n## Absorbing Data\n- Information overload leads to \"information blindness\"\n    - We can overcome this by forcing ourselves to grapple with the data\n- Disfluency\n    - Make the information disfluent, so you need to work to acquire it (You can create systems to create disfluency)\n    - Use the information in order to make it more memorable\n    - To understand data, play around with it\n- Reframing\n    - In order to avoid making rash decisions, reframe the questions you're asking yourself to see what the real concequences are"},{"id":"the-art-of-learning","title":"The Art of Learning","author":"Josh Waitzkin","date":"2018-08-14","stars":"4","isbn":"0743277457","content":"\n## The Foundation\n\n### Innocent Moves\n- Optimal learning comes from balancing discipline with enjoyment. This is how you improve without killing the game you are playing\n- To learn optimally, you should learn for enjoyment and not for competition or ego\n\n### Losing To Win\n- Confidence is key in competition, but at the same time overconfidence is fatal\n- Josh took some long breaks out at sea with his dad. He believes these breaks were instrumental in his success\n\n### Two Approaches To Learning\n- **Learning theory**: Hard work will get you to results (this is the approach you need to learn well)\n- **Entity theory**: You are born inherently good or bad at things (this is perfectionism)\n- Learning is a long term process, you need to take a learning theory mindset in order to keep going\n\n### Loving The Game\n- Seek out people who force you to be better\n- **Process > Results** - Internalise a \"process first\" approach to learning\n- Make your everyday feedback about effort, not about performance - This will move you toward a learning theory model and hence improve your learning\n- Enjoy the game - better at coming back from losses\n- **Always try your hardest** - We learn to grow our abilities by pushing them to their limits (growth comes at the point of most resistance)\n\n### The Soft Zone\n- **Hard zone**  \\= Demanding a cooperative world\n- **Soft zone** = At peace with the world in a fluid focus\n- 3 stages of entering the soft zone:\n\ta. Make peace with the discomforts, allowing yourself to be focused\n\tb. Use the discomforts to your advantage, creating an environment of optimal performance\n\tc. Be able to create the advantage without the need for the discomforts\n- Going through this process in different parts of your life will build mental Resilience\n- Being in the soft zone means using the flow of life, not fighting it\n\n### The Downward Spiral\n- A downward spiral comes from **reacting badly to mistakes**\n- To avoid this - re-enter yourself and be present\n- Be conscious that **problems breed progress**\n- It is easy to get angry following mistakes, it is much harder to re-centre yourself and objectively look at the mistake\n\n### Changing Voice\n- Josh took a break to Slovenia for a few months with just a backpack\n- The break reignited his love for studying and learning\n- He deepened his understanding and started to play chess for chess' sake again\n- **\"Numbers to leave numbers\":** What was once seen mathematically is now felt intuitively\n\n### Breaking Stallions\n- Approach learning with a **child mindset**\n  - Children do not fear failure, they approach learning from a fearless and fresh perspective\n- 2 methods of breaking in a horse\n  - Shock and awe - Force the student into a generic mould\n  - Gentling - Work with the students strengths to let them learn in a way which is best for them\n\n## My Second Art\n\n### Beginner's Mind\n- Looking at the learning process as though a beginner - Fresh feeling of learning opens new pathways\n- He **worked hard** at tai chi from the start, putting in hours every day\n- Tai chi changed his life\n- The best way to learn is by finding your \"natural voice\" and nurturing it\n\n### Investment In Loss\n- Investing in loss = \"Giving yourself to the learning process\"\n- Being comfortable with **losing in order to learn**\n- To get to optimal performance you should **minimise repeated errors** to learn the fastest. This is what is meant by investing in loss\n- Two key pillars of the learning process\n\t1. Beginners mind\n\t2. Investing in loss\n\n### Making Smaller Circles\n- **Depth > Breadth**\n- He trained for hours a day at push hands\n- **Master the fundamentals** - Internalise the fundamentals instead of learning a variety of skills (chess with 3 pieces)\n- Making smaller circles = \"**decreased extensiveness, increased potency\"**\n- \"Numbers to leave numbers\"\n- Start slow and incrementally improve\n\n### Using Adversity\n- It is important to take time for the mental side of your game - Reflection is invaluable\n- Using adversity = Noting how setbacks force you to higher performance, then **internalise the solution to the adversity** so you can raise your game without the setback\n- He broke his hand and won the national championships 8 weeks later\n\n### Slowing Down Time\n- The **conscious mind is limited** - \"numbers to leave numbers\" is the solution to this. It allows us to leave the performance to the unconscious mind\n- Road to mastery\n\t1. Fundamentals - Solid understanding of these, drilled relentlessly\n\t2. Expand repetoire - Guided by your perception\n\t3. Keep in touch with what you feel to be core to the discipline\n- **Chunking** is a method of grouping large sets of data together for your unconscious to make links and perform in a way that the conscious mind could not\n\n### The Illusion Of The Mystical\n- **\"At the opponents slightest move, I move first\"** - Subtly control the intentions of your opponent\n- **Balance** is key in virtually every sport\n- Programme your opponent unconsciously\n- At the top level of any sport, the battles are all psychological\n\n## Bringing It All Together\n\n### The Power Of Presence\n- You should always be present\n- Being present should be like breathing\n- When learning you must **maintain a present focus** and not just go through the motions\n- **Practise mindfully to compete mindfully**\n\n### Searching For The Zone\n- By forcing yourself to focus, you get better at focusing\n- **Practise focus and recovery**\n- The ability to relax and recover quickly is common to all top performers\n- Better at recovering means you will perform better under stress\n- Cardio interval training improves mental energy\n- **Apply the stress and recovery process** to all aspects of your life\n\n### Building Your Trigger\n- Build a routine that plays off what makes you feel most alert\n- Enjoy waiting - Your life is only ever the present moment so live it\n- **Make being present a habit** - Meditation is good for this\n- Take your trigger routine - Internalise it - Incrementally shorten it - Make it flexible\n\n### Making Sandals\n- \"To walk a thorny road, we may cover its every inch with leather or we can make sandals\"\n- If you can learn to control yourself then you can control any situation, instead of learning to control each situation individually\n- 3 steps of performance:\n\t1. Learn to flow with distraction\n\t2. Learn to use the distraction, inspiring ourselves\n\t3. Learn to recreate the inspiring settings internally\n- Become comfortable with all emotions - Channelling them to improve performance\n- **Train in adverse conditions** to make sure your sandals can make it over the road\n- Using your environment as toughening stimulation\n\t- **Use emotions as fuel**\n\t- Get comfortable with your emotions to increase your resilience\n\n### Bringing It All Together\n- Adjust the lessons in this book to your own personal disposition\n- **Know and use your unique strength** to win\n- Page 225 is a great summary of the whole book\n\n### Taiwan\n- Good foundations in a field make you flexible to changes\n- Stay present to not get rattled"},{"id":"lessons-of-history","title":"Lessons of History","author":"Will & Ariel Durant","date":"2018-06-12","stars":"4","isbn":"9781572702165","content":"\nWill and Ariel Durant wrote a beastly eleven-volume set of books called 'The Story of Civilization'. This book is a much more approachable summary of what the themes they found across those eleven books. I like it more than most history books I've read because it discusses themes and principles more than specific events. If you're looking to learn from history books then (as the name suggests), this one will give you some good education. Straight from the pen of those who have spent their lives studying it.\n\n### 1. Hesitations\n- The present is the past rolled up for action, while the past is the present unrolled for understanding\n \n### 2. History And The Earth\n- Historically, geography has played a significant part in history as countries with more coastline had more trade routes\n- As technology improves, geography is becoming less important\n \n### 3. Biology And History\n- Three lessons of history with regards to biological life\n1.\tLife is a competition\n  - Nowadays we just compete in groups (race, religion, football team, country)\n2.\tLife is selection\n  - Inequality is very natural\n  - Below average - Want equality\n  - Above average - Want freedom\n  - So therefore there is freedom as the above average are the ones with control\n3.\tLife must breed\n  - Nature has a passion for quantity\n \n### 4. Race And History\n- Historically, the purer races have had more success\n  - Eg Aryans and Nordics\n- Growth of the non-nordics --> History is colour blind\n- Civilizations create races, not the other way around\n \n### 5. Character And History\n- Human nature = The fundamental tendencies of mankind\n- The character of mankind has not changed throughout history much\n- Innovative \"men of action\" lead the way for the imitators (everyone else)\n \n### 6. Morals And History\n- Morality - Rules which compel society's members to behave in a way that is consistent with order, security and growth\n- 3 stages of history\n\t1.\tHunting\n\t2.\tAgriculture\n\t3.\tIndustry\n- Morals change throughout history\n- The morals of the industrial age are unclear at the moment\n \n### 7. Religion And History\n- \"As long as there is poverty there will be gods\" - Religion gives meaning to the poor\n- Historically, the church would hold all people responsible for their actions\n  - This enforces a moral code as everyone is accountable to the church\n- Industrial revolution: Religion --> Secularism\n- The story of religion = religion (morals) vs state (laws)\n  - Religion used to be winning but it has not been since the industrial revolution\n \n### 8. Economics And History\n- Marx: \"History is economics in action\"\n- At the end of the day all men are driven by a profit motive\n- A natural inequality of ability leads to a natural inequality of wealth\n  - This wealth is then redistributed by law following a revolution\n- The concentration of wealth is periodically redistributed by violent revolt\n \n### 9. Socialism And History\n- Socialism only seems to be preferable during war time\n- It inevitably leads to dictatorship and serfdom (Try to leave --> Forced to stay)\n- Socialism has failed many times in history, from Peru to China\n- Industrial revolution resurrected communism through Marx and Hegel (\"Communist manifesto\")\n- In recent years it appears that capitalist economies are embracing socialism and vice versa\n  - The world appears to be slowly moving toward a system somewhere in the middle\n \n### 10. Government And History\n- Government controls the limits to freedom\n  - The aim of government is to maximise freedom while establishing order\n- Nerva to Marcus Aurelius is regarded as the greatest ruling period\n- Historically, monarchy has proved better at ruling than democracy\n- States are very complex. Therefore oligarchy tends to perform better than monarchy as it is impossible for a single person to hold all that information in their head\n- \"Does history justify revolutions?\"\n- As things get more complex, inequality will get worse as those who understand will become more powerful and fewer in number\n- Democracy = The right to opportunity, not the right to power\n \n### 11. History And War\n- Individuals are restrained by morals and law, but states and countries are not. Hence there is war\n- Until 20th century war was always between aristocracies, then the people were brought into it\n \n### 12. Growth And Decay\n- There is no certainty that history will repeat the past, but there is some sort of life cycle\n- Civilizations do not have a life expectancy and they can live forever, the reason they don't is because something kills them\n- Civilizations are still driven by men of \"clear mind and energetic will\"\n \n### 13. Is Progress Real?\n- Science is a neutral existence, as it can both build and destroy\n- 3 measures of progress (and if we have progressed)\n  - Happiness (we are arguably less happy today than in hunter gatherer times)\n  - Control of environment (we certainly have more control of the world today)\n  - Education (we are more educated today both at the expert level and the baseline minimum childhood education)\n- Progress in heritage - We will always have a richer history than ever before as long as time keeps going forward\n \n"},{"id":"sapiens","title":"Sapiens","author":"Yuval Noah Harari","date":"2017-09-26","stars":"4","isbn":"9780099590088","content":"\nSapiens breaks the history of humanity down into 3 revolutions, which is how the book is set up. For each revolution, I've summarised the section, then saved some clippings from the book itself. \n\n> \"Luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations\"\n\n## The Cognitive Revolution (70,000 Years Ago)\n\n### Summary\n- Homo sapiens began to flood the planet, dominating large chunks of the globe\n- Harari says that they did this thanks to 1 advantage specifically - **language**\n  - The difference between animal language and human language is that humans can use language to talk about things that are not real\n  - This allows them to create imaginary situations, orders and rituals which bond tribes together and point large groups toward a common goal (religion, politics, money etc)\n- In the process of becoming smarter and more adept than other species, homo sapiens committed some of the greatest mass murders in history, and as a group we have wiped out more species than any other\n\n### Notes From Book\n- At the beginning of existence, there were many species of human - Homo erectus, homo sapiens, etc\n  - Homo sapiens originated in east Africa\n  - We became the smartest type of sapiens and hence took over during the cognitive revolution\n- The common myths that out language permitted is made us so good at operating in large groups\n- One-on-one, a human stood no chance against a neanderthal, but in large groups the neanderthals would lose battles badly\n- Dogs were the first domesticated animal, roughly 15,000 years ago\n\n## The Agricultural Revolution (12,000 Years Ago)\n\n### Summary\n- Humans stopped foraging about 12,000 years ago and began to settle down into farms. The transition from going to get the food, to bringing the food to us\n- In theory, farming gave us a better life, but Harari disputes this. He says that farming was the biggest fraud in history\n  - Longer working hours\n  - Easier spread of disease\n  - Worse nutrition from eating the same thing repetetively\n- He argues that the farms actually domesticated us, having us work harder to help wheat reproduce faster was arguably the success of the wheat, not us\n- Farms were also the birthplace of a new set of imagined realities - Kingdoms, nobility and gods\n- These new myths lead to mass opression of the poor (or simply the creation of the lower class)\n- In the agricultural revolution we also developed and perfected the use of numbers and writing for purposes such as tax, laws and accounting (in a very simplified way)\n\n### Notes From Book\n- The essence of the agricultural revolution = \"The ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions\"\n- Extra food translated into population explosion and pampered elites, not better lifestyles\n- But this was a trap - If population grows from 100 to 110, which 10 people will volunteer to die of starvation to go back to the better days with higher quality of life?\n- \"Luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations\"\n- This whole period showed the stark difference between evolutionary success and individual happiness, the population was booming from a growth perspective but everyone but the elite were in poverty\n- We are in an age of romantic consumerism - Romantic = We must have as many different experiences as possible. Consumerist = We must consume as many products as possible\n- On accounting and record keeping:\n  - The most important impact of script on human history is precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world. Free association and holistic thought have given way to compartmentalisation and bureaucracy\n- Many of those that signed the declaration of independence had slaves, as they considered the declaration to not apply to negroes\n- How the bible looks at marriage and rape: ‘If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife’\n- Money is the most useful system of mutual trust ever devised\n- \"Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion\"\n- Harari's theory of religion - \"So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief\"\n- The idea of buddhism is that craving is the enemy - we crave bad things to go away, and we crave good things to stay\n- Nirvana - \"When the flames are completely extinguished, craving is replaced by a state of perfect contentment and serenity, known as nirvana (the literal meaning of which is ‘extinguishing the fire’).\"\n\n\n## The Scientific Revolution (500 Years Ago)\n\n### Summary\n- Since the cognitive revolution, humans have tried to understand the universe\n- The main change in the scientific revolution is the acceptance that we don't know everything. This set the stage for testing hypotheses and humble research involving open minds\n- Also, the use of mathematics and physical laws were devevloped significantly in this stage\n- We are still in this stage\n- Lightning was believed to be god's wrath until Ben Franklin proved it wasn’t by inventing lightning rods\n- The driver of modern science is credit - Those with the money to fund research will ultimately succeed faster/greater than those who put less money into these discoveries\n- Scientists are controlling the minds of animals, they are extending the lives of people and curing them of illnesses\n  - Science is doing what religious people used to put down to god\n- Science is doing gods work\n- Anything is natural if it can occur - Nobody ever stops to make sure people are not photosynthesising because it cannot happen, but extending the life of a person through scientific research has occurred and hence is natural\n\n### Notes From Book\n- The founders of scottish windows, Webster and Wallace first applied statistics to the death of priests\n- Scientists usually assume that no theory is 100 per cent correct. Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. The real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes knowledge.\n- _\"The Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge concluded that this was not enough. To obtain the most accurate results it was imperative to send an astronomer all the way to the south-western Pacific Ocean. The Royal Society resolved to send an eminent astronomer, Charles Green, to Tahiti, and spared neither effort nor money. But, since it was funding such an expensive expedition, it hardly made sense to use it to make just a single astronomical observation. Green was therefore accompanied by a team of eight other scientists from several disciplines, headed by botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander. The team also included artists assigned to produce drawings of the new lands, plants, animals and peoples that the scientists would no doubt encounter. Equipped with the most advanced scientific instruments that Banks and the Royal Society could buy, the expedition was placed under the command of Captain James Cook, an experienced seaman as well as an accomplished geographer and ethnographer\"_ - James cook lead the expedition of experiments which calculated the suns distance from the earth\n-  Amerigo Vespucci argued for the existence of America, whereas most people throught it was the east coast of Asia. So a famous mapmaker drew a map and called this \"new continent\" America, after him. - This is how america got its name\n- Wall Street  \\- the Dutch West Indies Company, or WIC, plied the Atlantic. In order to control trade on the important Hudson River, WIC built a settlement called New Amsterdam on an island at the river’s mouth. The colony was threatened by Indians and repeatedly attacked by the British, who eventually captured it in 1664. The British changed its name to New York. The remains of the wall built by WIC to defend its colony against Indians and British are today paved over by the world’s most famous street – Wall Street\"\n- The industrial schedule - \"An alarm clock wakes us up at 7 a.m., we heat our frozen bagel for exactly fifty seconds in the microwave, brush our teeth for three minutes until the electric toothbrush beeps, catch the 07:40 train to work, run on the treadmill at the gym until the beeper announces that half an hour is over, sit down in front of the TV at 7 p.m. to watch our favourite show, get interrupted at preordained moments by commercials that cost $1,000 per second, and eventually unload all our angst on a therapist who restricts our prattle to the now standard fifty-minute therapy hour\""},{"id":"21-lessons-for-the-21st-century","title":"21 Lessons for the 21st Century","author":"Yuval Noah Harari","date":"2017-07-22","stars":"4","isbn":"9780771048852","content":"\nYuval Noah Harari\n\nKey Themes\n- AI and technology will create a class of humans which suffer from irrelevance, adding no value to the world\n- There is a big difference between believing my country is unique, and it is supreme\n- The future requires adaptability, not technical skills. We need to be learing how to be flexible and resiliant, not how to operate specific pieces of machinery\n- Nationalism = My nation is unique, Fascism = My nation is supreme\n \n## 1. Disillusionment\t\n- Humans think in stories. In the 20th century the main ones were:\n  - Fascism - Eliminated in world war 2\n  - Communism - Eliminated in the post world war 2 period (cold war)\n  - Liberalism - lives on as the winner in most societies\n- Harari argues that now, in 2018, we are down to 0 working stories (Liberalism is failing)\n- AI has already augmented us\n- Populist revolts may not work when the thing you are protesting is irrelevance\n \n## 2. Work\n- Technology will eventually be able to detect human emotions by using biomechanics, which will mean that it can begin to replace more relationship based jobs like Bankers and Nurses\n- The job market in 2050 will be very different to today thanks to AI, jobs will be destroyed but will also be created\n- Universal basic income (capitalist paridise) vs Universal basic services (Communist paridise)\n- Wealth inequality is likely to increase as the jobs that used to be done by indian children are now done by a 3d printer, funding tech giants instead of poor families\n \n## 3. Liberty\n- Voting is not about what you think, it is about what you feel\n- Self driving cars don’t need to be perfect, they just need to be better than humans (not hard)\n- Big data is watching you\n- The invention of the biometric sensor is a big one as it turns human feelings into data that a computer can process\n- Will we lose the free will to choose things as computers become so tuned in to what we want that we no longer need to choose? Is this a good thing?\n- Once humans begin to trust the algorithms, we will stop knowing what they are doing and will no longer be able to explain what it is doing\n \n## 4. Equality\n- The new currency of this century is data\n- Those who own the data own the future\n- Key question: How do you regulate the ownership of data?\n- If you cannot see the data that is coming from an interaction, you are the data\n- The richest 1% may eventually be able to buy better bodies and brains, so not only are they richer than you, they can not afford to be bigger and smarter than you too\n \n## 5. Community\n- Humans are being detatched from their bodies by tehnology\n- Physical communities are being broken up by technology\n- It is easier than ever to talk to someone on the other side of the world but harder than ever to do so in person because they are always on their phone\n \n## 6. Civilisation\n- Small civilisations have been merging into larger and larger ones thanks to technology\n- \"We are all cogs within a single global production line\"\n- Globalisation --> A single large civilisation\n- We have lost the little civilisations that used to exist\n \n## 7. Nationalism\n- There is nothing wrong with being patriotic, but there is definitely something wrong with being excessively nationalistic.\n- There is a big difference between believing my country is unique, and it is supreme\n- The environment\n  - The water footprint of eating meat is huge\n  - Technology is providing us with substitutes to meat, by growing it in a lab\n- 3 threats facing humanity:\n  - Technology\n  - Nuclear\n  - Ecological\n- We have a global economy and national politics, this mismatch must change for the world to work\n \n## 8. Religion\n- Marx was very against religion, saying it has nothing to add to political debate\n- We need to distinguish between 3 types of problem:\n1.\tTechnical problems - How farmers deal with dead crops\n2.\tPolicy problems - What measures should governments adopt to stop global warming\n3.\tIdentity problems - Why should someone care about the problems of this farmer\n \n## 9. Immigration\n- Definition\n1.\tHost country allows immigrants into the country\n2.\tIn return, immigrants embrace the norms and values of the country\n3.\tAfter sufficient time the country accepts the immigrant as a full member of the country\n- He says you cant be too tolerant, if you allow too many people from the middle east into your country you start to look like the middle east and lose your national identity\n \n## 10. Terrorism\n- It is like a fly in a china shop, the only way it can cause damage is by getting into the ear of the bull\n- Terrorism annoys angers countries into overreaction\n \n## 11. War\n- There is less war now are the valuable commodity is data\n- You cannot go to silicon valley and steal the silicon in the same way you could go to india and steal the gold\n- The main commodity is knowledge, so there will not be physical wars to get knowledge, but more likely technological ones\n \n## 12. Humility\n- You are not the centre of the world\n- Apes and humans developed the tendency to help the poor and needy long before the bible came about\n- Crediting christianity with the concept of generosity is like crediting the jews with the theory of relativity\n \n## 13.14: God/Secularism\n- Harari says morality has nothing to do with god, you just need to understand suffering to have a firm grasp on being a moral person\n- Secularism promotes truth above all things\n- Belief usually is required when something is not true\n- This commitment to truth via secularism has spurred modern science\n- Religion often claims to be perfect, but you always trust somebody more who is open with their flaws than someone who says they have none\n \n## 15. Ignorance\n- Accepting ignorance is key\n- Nobody knows everything\n- On free will: We don’t even know about our own behavioural biases most of the time, we are largely ignorant of this\n- We rely on experts for an ever increasing amount of information\n- We treat the knowledge in the minds of others as if it were our own, so we thing we know a lot when we don’t\n- As a result, we should be investing time into fact checking an\n- You need to experiment with unproductive paths to fully understand a topic, which requires a lot of time\n \n## 17. Post-Truth\n- Football clubs bring out something inside of us which ensures we take a side\n- Harari says that the nations and religions are like football clubs on steroids\n- It is the responsibility of all of us to verify the sources of information that we use, which we can do in a number of ways:\n  - If you want good information, pay good money for it - Brainwashing information (like facebook) is free, good quality information (like some academic journals) is not free\n  - If an issue is important to you, make the effort to read the scientific literature on the subject\n \n## 18. Science Fiction\n- Far more people watch TV shows like black mirror and movies like the matrix and terminator\n- So science fiction producers need to be more responsible with what they are putting out, as it has more impact on the collective view of technology than academic research does\n- In thinking about the future, Karl Marx is still a better guide than Steven Spielberg\n \n## 19. Education\n- The change in required learning\n  - The information that children learn at the moment is not going to be useful in 2050 when they actually get around to applying it\n  - What they really need to be teaching in schools is \"learning how to learn\" and adaptability\n  - Need to move from learning hard technical skills to softer and more general life skills\n- Getting used to changing and unfamiliar situations\n- Preserving mental balance in these situations\n- Information overflow\n  - We are bombarded with too much information on everything, the last thing a teacher needs to do is give the pupils more information than they already have\n- Adults like stability a bit too much, which makes them more vulnerable to the future than the 15 year olds, so Harari's advice is not to take on board too much of what the adults say, stay childish and flexible\n- Stories\n  - If you want someone to believe a story, induce them to make a sacrifice on its behalf.\n- Giving diamond rings to lovers\n- Spending 30 years reading the scriptures of a religion\n  - After the sacrifice, the sunk cost bias will do the rest and they will force themselves to believe the story\n- Teachings of budda\n  - Everything is constantly changing\n  - Nothing has any enduring essence\n  - Nothing is completely satisfied\n \n## 20. Meaning\n- The universe does not give any meaning to your life, you do that yourself\n- Don’t try to fit yourself into a ready made plan\n- Humans have the freedom to do what we desire, but not to choose what we desire\n \n## 21. Meditation\n- The deepest source of suffering is our own minds\n- Suffering is something that our minds experience, not something that is objectively happening in the outside world\n- Meditation is about how you get in touch with reality\n- Harari sees meditation as a scientific tool which can be used to view conciousness\n \n \n \n \n\n"},{"id":"7-brief-lessons-on-physics","title":"7 Brief Lessons on Physics","author":"Carlo Rovelli","date":"2017-06-28","stars":"4","isbn":"9780399184437","content":"\n### Most beautiful Theory\n- Einstein discovered that the gravitational field IS the space Newton talked about\n- Cosmic background radiation from the big bang (explosion of a small overheated universe that made our large ever expanding one) is proof of the big bang\n \n### Quanta\n- The idea of light as photons (packets of energy)\n- Werner Heisenberg devised the idea that electrons only exist when being interacted with, and that when not so, they are simply a calculable probability, this helped with the quantum leap theory/idea\n- Quantum mechanics is using the idea that no object has a definite position unless colliding with something else\n- To this day we cannot prove why this theory holds, we just accept it\n \n### Architecture of the Cosmos\n- Corpernicus proved the earth wasn't the centre of everything \n- The universe began as a small ball and exploded into its current cosmic dimensions\n- There are billions of planets out there just like Earth, as our galaxy is one of billions\n- A grain of sand on a beach has more significance than our galaxy in the universe\n \n### Particles\n- Quarks are glued together by gluons to make protons and neutrons\n- Electrons quarks photons and gluons are the elementary particles that make up everything around us, they fluctuate between existence and non existence according to quantum theory\n- \"Standard model of elementary particles\"\n- There is a large cloud of dark matter surrounding every galaxy\n- Dark matter is just something we know is there but don't know what it is, and the standard model doesn't explain it\n \n### Loop Quantum Gravity Theory\n- Quantum mechanics and general relativity conflict each other but are both such good theories \n- Loop quantum gravity theory says that space is made up of minute particles (atoms of space) that link together to give the texture of space\n- The atoms of space are not in space because they are space\n- This theory does not include time, everything moves on its own time scale and there is no universal passing of time\n- A black hole is a rebounding Planck star that is expanding in extreme slow motion, if you were on the star of would seem fast as the lack of gravity speeds up time\n- This theory says that the big bang was actually a bounce outward following a previous universe collapsing in on itself like a black hole for universes\n \n### Probability, Time and The Heat of Black Holes\n- Heat is atoms vibrating more quickly \n- Heat proves that time exists, without friction (heat transfer) a pendulum would fluctuate forever and if you played it in reverse would seem the same, but with friction you can tell the future (small fluctuations) from the past (larger fluctuations)\n- Boltzmann discovered that heat moves from hot to cold due to probability. It is much more likely a fast vibrating particle hits a still one than vise versa, and due to the conservation of energy it gives energy to the still one\n- We don't know how gravitational field are affected by heat. How does space-time change with heat? It must vibrate but what does vibrating time look like\n- We do not say that things not 'here' don't exist so why do we say things not 'now' don't exist? This confuses physicists\n- Hawking proved black holes are always hot using quantum mechanics\n- His theory combines all 3 main physics approaches, quantum mechanics, general relativity and thermodynamics\n \n### Ourselves \n- \"Integrated information theory\" - theory about the structure of a system that makes it concious. What changes when we sleep etc\n- To be free means to make decisions based on what's going on in your mind. Not externally \n- \"Homo\" species are characterised by being curious (humans, chimps, Neanderthals)\n\n"},{"id":"homo-deus","title":"Homo Deus","author":"Yuval Noah Harari","date":"2017-04-28","stars":"4","isbn":"9780771038686","content":"\n## Part 0: The New Human Agenda\n\nThis book is a history of the future, it uses the past 300 years to predict how humans will develop into god's in the future (it may turn out different)\n\n### New Human Agenda\n- We aim to attain divinity (not omnipotence!) Sort of like the Greek gods\n- Peace is not a default, not war\n- War is no longer profitable as we have moved from material economies to information economies\n\n### A-Mortality\n- Not immortality (=god)\n- Lead to less risk taking - why risk infinity?\n\n### Human Rights\n- Right to pursuit of happiness\n- Right to liberty\n- Right to life\n\n### Pursuit Of Happiness\n- We use drugs to emulate chemical feelings we can get naturally, but for less effort\n- The harder we try to achieve happiness the more miserable we may become\n\n### Enhancing Humanity\n- The same tech that can replace a severed leg can improve a perfectly normal one\n- Idea that we can extrapolate bringing people back to the norm through to improving the norm\n- Plastic surgery started off saving war veterans and now is focused on footballers\n\n### Learning From History\n- Gardens began as signs of wealth, as the poor couldn't afford to waste the land (untameable proof of your richness)\n- What we learn from history is not to repeat it, but to do it differently and see how things change\n\n## Part 1: Homo Sapiens Conquers The World\n- Evolution from thousands of years ago has shaped animals into something humans are forcing them not to be (pigs want to roam but are battery processed in cages)\n\n### Algorithms\n- \\= methodical set of steps that can be used to make calculations, resolve problems and reach decisions\n\t- EG calculating the average or the recipe for a meal\n\n### Theory Of Evolution\n- Natural selection says that parts of us are iterated toward improvement over generations\n- Being individual means we cannot be divided, so cannot be iterated and so contradicts natural selection (we have no souls)\n\n### The Mind\n- The mind subjectively reacts to neurones but the traffic jam doesn't subjectively react to the cars\n- The mind (consciousness) is us feeling\n- The best theory of the mind/consciousness is that it is mental pollution - a biproduct of billions of firing neurones (much like the noise of a jet plane engines, in reality serving no purpose)\n- If the mind can be replicated by electoral impulses then it could be year 2250 and you're in a simulation, given there could be infinite simulations (close enough given billions of neurones) the probability youre in the real world is roughly 0\n\n### Cooperation\n- Homo sapiens dominate the world not because of our intelligence but because of our ability to communicate and cooperate in large numbers flexibly\n- If cooperation is all that separates sapiens from animals then should we at all be reverted to be special? Do we have souls?\n- Ultimatum game - one player splits $100 and the other decides to accept the split or make nobody get anything (should be equilibrium at 99-1 but really at 60-40)\n\n### Web Of Meaning\n- Humans only believe in objective reality (like gravity) and subjective reality (like an unexplainable headache)\n- There is actually also intersubjective reality which is reality created by the belief of masses (like the value of a dollar bill/beleif in God) - creates a web of meaning (it has value because all your friends also believe it does, and they believe because you do)\n\n## Part 2: Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning To The World\n\n### Invention Of Writing\n- Enables more complex stories and algorithms to be recorded (doesnt matter who the doctor is he's following a WRITTEN code of practice)\n\n### Failures Of Writing\n- Mao of China ordered increases in agriculture that were unobtainable. So those recording grain production lied, this was amplified all the way up the chain of command until it said that production was 50% more that it really was. China then bought lots of weapons in return for their grain and experienced an aweful famine\n\n### Divorce And Monotheists\n- The same way small kids are childish in thinking the divorce is due to them, monotheists are childiah for thinking droughts are because of their sins\n- The irony of putting your hand on a Bible and swearing to tell the truth is comedic given the book is filled with fiction\n\n### Stories\n- They are tools without which humanity cannot function\n- They should not be seen as real (this is what religion does)\n\n### Science And Religion\n- Religion = any all encompassing story that confers superhuman legitimacy onto human laws, this explaining everything through an external force\n- Science requires religion to give us values to live by, science just explains the laws of the world. Someone must create rules/values.\n\t- Three gorges damn economic Vs ethical issues\n- Sam Harris argues that all ethical arguments conceal some facts, and so science can prove/disprove ethical statements\n\n### The Modern Covenant\n- The deal says - humans agree to give up on meaning in exchange for power\n- Humans are not confined to any predetermined role in the modern world so they do as they please because 'shit happens'\n\n### The Modern Pursuit Of Power\n- Growth is key, confidence in growth is displayed through provision of credit which fuels business financing and therefore future growth\n- Significant global figures take more risks today because they assumed scientific discovery will save things even if they're wrong (Eg air cleaning domes in Beijing instead of less pollution) \n\n### The Humanist Revolution\n- Humanism is like replacing god with yourself/humanity\n- If it feels good and doesnt make anyone else feel bad - do it\n- Humanist equation: knowledge = experience \\* sensitivity\n- An experience = sensations, emotions, thoughts\n- You only respect the outcome of a vote if you believe you share experiences and thoughts with everyone else that voted. Otherwise you'll think it doesn't count because they don't understand\n- Liberal humanism - each human is special and should do as they please (you're free to starve) - capitalistic properties\n- Socialist humanism - humans are special but should do what is best for ALL humans\n- Evolutionary humanism - survival of the fittest, what doesn't kill you improves you and you should extinct the weak (Nazis are an extreme version)\n- Socialism (Marx, Lenin) went along with production and hence progressed through the industrial revolution whereas Buddhism/other religions didn't\n- Now liberalism is doing to socialism what socialism did you Buddhism. The information age is dominated by liberalism\n\n## Part 3: Homo Sapiens Loses Control\n\n### The Time Bomb Of The Laboratory\n- Science has discovered that humans are made up of genes, neurones etc. And their mutations can be random. So humans are not at all free --> this skrews liberalism (think of the uranium robot picking right or left)\n- Through probabilities and random determination science has proved freedom doesn't really exist\n- Theory of evolution backs this up\n- Humans are free to act upon their desires, but they aren't free to choose them\n- Robot rats show how if there is no free will, then humans are 100% controllable\n\n### Who Is I?\n- Liberalism centres on your true self choosing as it pleases - but is there only 1 self?\n- Kahneman proved there is a narrating self and a experiencing self with his \"long\" and \"short\" cold water experiment - peak end rule doesn't aggregate, it averages. (Narrating self is the inner voice)\n\n### The Great Decoupling Of Intelligence And Conciousness\n- For now, in armies and corporations Intelligence is mandatory, conciousness is optional\n- This paves the way for computers\n- After winning jeaproady IBM's Watson has been focusing on medical diagnosis\n- Computers always break barriers we don't think they could - We used to think recognising faces was inherently human\n- VITAL is an algorithm given a chair on the management of a large Chinese company - it can vote and usually does so in favour of giving more power to algorithms\n- Page 378 - humans can compose algorithms\n- It's clear that computers will take a lot of human jobs. So the key is to make NEW jobs that humans do better than algorithms\n- \"Self Knowledge through numbers\" - giving all your biometric data to an algorithm that will tell you all about yourself\n- 23andme can help you \"know thyself\" for $99\n- Liberalism will collapse the day computer algorithms know us better than we know ourselves. As at that point every decision is better off being made by the algorithm\n- A study done by Facebook found that on average 300 likes is all it needs to predict your result of a personality test better than your spouse (70 for friends)\n- Scary part is we will be better for it\n\n### 3 Potential Futures\n\n1. Humans lose their value completely\n2. Humans are still valuable as a collective, to perform tasks that only a human can do, but the individual in each of us has no value\n3. There are a select few specialists that retain individual value and they will constitute an elite of upgraded humans\n\n### 3 Upgrading Inequality\n- Liberalism still assumes the value of the poor is equal to the rich (1 vote each) - will this stay even when there are biological differences?\n- If this superhuman elite develop, liberalism will collapse as not all humans can be valued equally\n\n### Techno Humanism\n- Homo sapiens has run its course, but through technology it can become homo Deus and continue to make history\n- Techno - humanism assumes we know and understand the mind fully. We really don't, we only scratch the surface of the spectrum of consciousness\n- Humanity never fully pays attention to things because of the FOMOA - Fear of Missing Out\n- If we gained the technological ability to control human desire, humans become another designer product\n\n### The Data Religion\n- Everything can be explained through data flows\n- Data algorithms give a common language to all sciences\n- The biggest breakthrough is the discovery that organisms are still just complex algorithms\n- Distributed data processing (like a stock exchange where the fee market decides prices) is superior to centralised data processing (like communist Russia)\n- World leaders lack the vision to do anything with the powerful technology available - Hollywood villains and Hitler were at least people with vision\n- Dataism believes humans are merely tools to create the \"internet of all things\""},{"id":"how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people","title":"How to Win Friends and Influence People","author":"Dale Carnegie","date":"2017-04-18","stars":"5","isbn":"9780091906818","content":"\n## Fundamental Techniques In Handling People\n\n1. **Don't criticize, condemn or complain**\n  - Any fool can complain, it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving\n\n2. **Give honest and sincere appreciation**\n  - There is only one way to get someone to do something, and that is by making them want to do it\n  - People crave to be appreciated\n\n3. **Arouse in the other person an eager want**\n  - In order to influence people you must talk about what they want and show them how to get it\n  - Before you speak, look at things from the other persons perspective and consider what they want\n\n## Six Ways To Make People Like You\n\n1. **Become genuinely interested in other people**\n  - They have a lot to offer and it is arrogant not to listen to them\n  - Don't try to make people interested in you!\n  - We are interested in others when they are interested in us\n  - Greet people with genuine enthusiasm\n\n2. **Smile**\n  - People succeed at things they have fun doing\n  - So do what you love, then tell your face!\n  - Actions speak louder than words\n\n3. **Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language**\n  - Remember and use people's names\n  - Saying someone's name is like a subconscious complement to them\n  - Try to associate their name with their features\n  - Ask them how to spell it\n\n4. **Be a good listener.

But that's like using a hammer to kill someone, when used correctly neuromarketing is incredibly useful\n\n## 1. The Largest Neuromarketing Study Ever Conducted\n- Used a functional MRI machine (fMRI) to measure brain activity of smokers during 4 hours of not smoking\n- China contributes to 1/3 of all smoking in the world\n- In the scanner the smokers were shown the adverts that go on cigarette packets, and they had no effect on making smokers want to smoke less, just stimulated a craving area in the brain.\n- The interesting part is that in a questionnaire beforehand, all the smokers said that the ads did affect them\n- Focus groups and surveys don't account for the little things we unconsciously react to such as the surveyor is a feminist so we don't like the product\n- By looking at the brain we get past all these micro-emotions, an fMRI or SST machine doesn't lie or get embarrassed, so the results aren't unreliable.\n- In a coke Vs pepsi test, pepsi won the experiment, but people prefer coke because a whole can is nicer than pepsi, which can be too sugary.\n- The experiment was repeated but the people were told beforehand if they were about to drink Coke or Pepsi. This time coke won because it engages emotionally with us a lot more.\n- Emotion is one of the keys to value\n- Our brains react to fear more than they do to attraction, so lots of adverts use fear to change our behaviour\n\n## 2. Product Placement, American Idol And Ford'S Multimillion Dollar Mistake\n- Coming out with an original advert is risky to companies so they don't do it. So nobody stands out enough to be memorable.\n- Nowadays it's harder to distinguish product integration (part of the plot of a movie) from product placement\n- Coca cola and ford both paid over $20 mil to have product placement or advertising time\n- Ray ban sales rose by 50% following Tom cruise wearing them on top gun (so did navy enrollment, by 500%)\n- The best measure of an adverts effectiveness is how memorable it is\n- Excessive product placement makes the product more memorable, it also inhibits the memory of other products\n- Coke was the only memorable ad, because it was integrated into the TV show, ford was just a normal advert and lost money as a result\n- product placement only works if it fits with the plot of the movie/show.\n\n## 3. Mirror Neurones At Work\n- mirror neurones are neurones that fire when you perform an action or when you see someone else perform the same action\n- when watching cheaters experience pain, men felt pleasure while women felt empathy\n- From a consumer perspective, guitar hero makes you feel like jagger, you like that so you buy one\n- Dopamine is released when mirror neurones fire, and it's the most addictive substance in our bodies (pleasure drug)\n\n## 4. Subliminal Messaging, Alive And Well\n- Subliminal advertising = Subconscious messages conveyed by advertiser's to affect our actions\n- Eg, putting an image of coca cola in a movie for 1/30th of a second\n- Subliminal messages of smiling or angry faces affects our emotions and makes us want to pay more/less for something (happy = more)\n- subliminal advertising has little to do with the product and a lot to do with our brain.\n- Cigarette companies install \"Marlborough motels\" that convey subliminal messages because they can't advertise on TV\n- By banning conventional cigarette ads, tabacco companies have been forced to evolve their advertising into the future\n- subliminal cigarette ads have the same effect as blatant ones, but with subliminal ones you don't put up defences against them so they can sometimes be more effective\n\n## 5. Ritual, Superstition And Why We Buy\n- the line in a Corona thing started when a bartended lost a bet to serve a Corona with a lime in it\n- associating products with rituals makes them more memorable\n- there's a sense of stability in having a favourite coffee or shampoo etc, it makes us feel in control\n- the ritual of collecting things makes us feel in control\n\n## 6. Faith, Religion And Brands\n- people pay large amounts of money to import holy Israeli dirt or Irish dirt or to buy holy water that has been blessed by a priest.\n- 10 basic pillars of religion: sense of belonging, clear vision/mission, power over enemies, sensory appeal, storytelling, grandeur, evangelism, symbols, mystery, rituals.\n- these 10 pillars can be easily likened to large companies whom advertise products to us\n- sensory appeal: the sensory feel of a temple isn't all too different from getting into a Mercedes, the control of our emotions is the same\n- power over enemies: coke Vs pepsi is the same as Jews Vs Christians\n- storytelling: the Bible isn't dissimilar to the stories in adverts or Disney movies\n- grandeur: Vatican city is the same idea as the bolagio hotel, big and awesome\n- symbols: the cross and the dove are the same as company logos to us\n- mystery: god being real compared to the secret coca cola recipe\n- ritual: praying Vs slice of lime in a Corona\n- smashable- if you smashed it you would still know it's brand. Clothes aren't smashable because the brand is the logo, a broken iPod is still an iPod, 2 drops of guinness is still Guinness\n- strong brands Vs weak brands Vs religion experiment: strong brands cause more brain activity than weak ones.\n- interestingly, strong brands and religious images cause the SAME brain activity - they elicit the same emotional response!\n\n## 7. The Power Of Somatic Markers\n- somatic marker = past life experiences that connect to a specific emotion and sometimes require a specific reaction\n- Michelin star --> good --> Michelin tyres\n- Andrex --> puppy --> soft --> buy\n- basically any memorable positive event(s) you can relate to a product, or a negative experience to push you to need a product to prevent the anxiety\n- ritalin and Adderall are sold because parents fear if their ADD kid doesn't concentrate he'll fail in life\n\n## 8. Selling To Our Senses\n- sensory branding - associating a combinations of senses with the brand\n- images and smells are just as effective on their own, but when combined they're much more pleasurable\n- the same is true for images and sounds\n- obviously the scent and sight must fit together\n- you react to smell more primally than sight/sound. It brings back memories without you having to think about it\n- bakeries are put in supermarkets so the fresh bread makes you hungry do you buy more food you didn't plan on buying\n- you don't have to notice the smell either, a lemony aroma will Subconscious make you do things in a cleaner manner\n- feel is significant too, we tend to thing heavier things have higher quality which lead B and O to put aluminium (for no function) in their products to make them feel better quality\n- colours have a huge effect on purchasing too, pink is associated with femininity and sensuality hence it's the colour of most women's underwear\n- sound (in the form of jingles mostly) is a good way to be memorable as it can get stuck in your head\n- a study they did shows that the Nokia ringtone is a negative somatic marker and is actually harming the brand\n- Overall: senses affect our emotions, but complementry combinations of senses do it way better, making us more likely to buy\n\n## 9. Neuromarketing And Predicting The Future\n- Steve Jobs said segways would revolutionise the future, expecting 40,000 sales a month, in a few years it only sold 2,000 total.\n- producers aren't good at predicting how consumers will react to a product launch\n- conducted a TV show based experiment to see if neuromarketing could tell successful shows from unsuccessful ones\n- the successful show engaged people much more and had a stronger emotional connection\n- they said they hated quizmania but their brains say they loved it\n- when it aired, the highest rated was most successful, the lowest rates was least successful and the middle rated was middle successful (from the brain scans)\n- this shows we can use neuromarketing to see how successful a product will be before committing to all it's necessary processes (it can kinda predict the future)\n- companies will swap focus groups for SST caps\n\n## 10. Sex In Advertising\n- roughly 1 in 5 adverts we see have sexual connotations\n- vampire effect: sexual content in adverts sucks attention from the company and product toward the sexual nature, basically men don't care what the hot woman is selling they just stare at her tits\n- this vampire effect also applies to using good looking people or celebrities in adverts, they distract you from the point of the advert - John classes smoking advert failed because people just saw funny John cleese and not \"stop smoking\"\n- the US department of justice investigated kalvin Klein for breaching child pornography laws in some of its commercials (the one made to mimic low budget porn in motels) but he was never charged\n- sex itself isn't what sells, it's the controversy surrounding it that gives the brand free publicity, that's what sells\n- The shock factor of seeing softcore porn on a billboard makes the advert more memorable\n- On the whole we are more receptive to ordinary people in adverts who we feel are similar to ourselves. They are more relatable and the realness of these people creates authenticity and we feel we can trust them\n- mirror neurones however make us feel as sexy and attractive as the people in the boxers we are about to buy.\n- the Gillette strategy is targeting advertising to who's going to buy the product, most Gillette razors are bought by men's wives, because the wives want their men to look like the guy in the advert\n- to maintain the shock factor, it's possible that adverts will begin to get more and more sexual and eventually it will backtrack and all sexual advertising will be subliminal and suggedtive\n\n## 11. The Future Of Marketing And Advertising\n- When using an fMRI to study pleasure in the brain when people tasted some of different tastes and prices, the same wine was presented twice with different price tags and they found that higher price increases the pleasure of consumption\n- fear scares people away if it feeds on general anxieties we have, but if you target specific insecurities that can easily be fixed it is a very powerful marketing instrument\n- when we feel out of control we seek solid foundations and become more dependent on dopamine, when were more dependent on dopamine we tend to seek out more \"stuff\" to satisfy our dopamine need\n- we value special things more, wether it is rational or not. I give you a rock and you don't care, but I tell you it's from the moon and now it's a very valuable thing to you, the rock hasn't changed at all though.\n- humans brands like Paris Hilton and Richard Branson are likely to increase in popularity in the future he thinks, as they are 24 hour brands\n\n## 12. Good Times, Bad Times\n- the 2008 recession had significant shock factor and became a somatic marker to many consumers, telling them that it's a bad idea to consume at the levels they used to.\n- Fear of losing job/income stopped Americans buying cars, so hayundai said that if you lose your job within a year of buying a car, you can return it, sales went up 33%\n- he argues the crisis of 2008 was necessary to stop us spending beyond our means and keep us in financial order\n- discounts actually make you buy less, when you buy a shirt at 70% off, when it's at full price, maybe you would buy it, but not when it's value to you is now 70% off, you won't buy at full price. On average it takes 7 years for the value of the product to recover from a discounting! 7 years!\n- studies have also shown that we become addicted to discounts, searching for the lowest prices and best value becomes obsessive\n- the price of a good is valued relative to its peers/nearest rivals, not the absolute monetary value\n- more choice leads to less purchasing, as more choice makes choices harder"},{"id":"black-box-thinking","title":"Black Box Thinking","author":"Matthew Syed","date":"2011-10-14","stars":"3","isbn":"9781591848226","content":"\nBlack boxes are the tracking machines in planes that record data.
