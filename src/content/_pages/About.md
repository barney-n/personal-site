It's commonly said that explaining something helps you learn it, so you could say I'm selfishly using the this blog and its reader(s) for my own benefit.However, I prefer to think of it as an interested observer's perspective on how things work. I'll most likely focus my writing on the below topics, but no promises.

- **Markets** - Mainly factor investing, statistical risk premia, systematic trading and behavioural economics
- **Computer Science** - Machine learning, website design, algorithm design and general programming problems
- **Psychology** - Behavioural biases and how both actions and habitsaffect our brain
- **Chess**
- **Poker**

Since starting work my little projects have taken a backseat, but the main ones that I've worked on are:

### Libry

This is a website I am working on with a friend of mine. The goal is to make a **good** online reading tracker and review tool. Sites like goodreads are ancient in their architecture and must be improved upon, thats what we are trying to do. You can follow the development on the [github page](https://github.com/barney-n/libry-frontend)

### Nanovert

I helped some friends create a company called [nanovert](https://www.nanovert.co.uk/) that allows 'nano-influencers' to get discount on items by posting social media stories advertising what they bought. I built the first iteration of the web app that companies used to log the visits of influencers.

### This website

Beyond those above, I spend time writing essays, tweaking code and improving designs on my website.
