## Antifragile: An Introduction

- A little bit of something bad is good for you
  - E.g Having a good competitor or using white noise to sleep
- Information is antifragile
- Certain jobs are more antifragile than others. Think of an author vs a CEO (Any press is good press for an author)
- _Iatrogenics_: When a treatment causes more harm than good - I.e intervening in something had a negative impact
  - For example a personal doctor will make you take lots of medication you don’t need for the sake of naïve intervention
- Fragility - You have more to lose than you do to gain, volatility hinders you
- Antifragility - You have more to gain than you do to lose, volatility benefits you

## Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility

- Society relies on control
- People want so much control that they become antifragile
- "Light control works, close control leads to overreaction"
- We vaccinate our children each year but do not do the same in other disciplines for adults/politicians
- _Naïve Intervention_: Intervening just because you feel as though you should do something (Needing close control)
- Modern society struggles to filter the signal from the noise - There is so much information going around and we aim to react to all of it, not just the important parts

## A Non-Predictive View of the World

- Stoicism in the modern day
  - \= "Someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking
  - Stoicism is an antifragile philosophy of not controlling what needn't be controlled
- Barbell strategy
  - Aiming to survive before you thrive
  - For example choosing a portfolio where you have 90% cash and 10% in volatile assets - You won't lose all your portfolio, which is a real possibility if you are in a 60/40 bond equity one

## Optionality, Technology and the Intelligence of Antifragility

- Optionality allows you to benefit from asymmetry and volatility
- Having and creating more options mean that unexpected events in your life are now beneficial
- Options have unlimited gain with a limited loss - This is a positive asymmetry that you should be exposing yourself to
- "An option is the weapon of antifragility"
- Technological advances come as a result of tinkering, of trial and error. I.e from antifragile researchers
- **A lesson in disorder** - The best chapter
  - Life education is not the same as classroom education
  - You need to go out and read your own books which you found
  - Meet people, have conversations
  - Try new experiences
  - School cannot teach you these things, but they are exactly what makes you antifragile and robust to life
  - Reading is an act full of optionality - You can choose a book and then not read it if you don't want
  - "The trick is to be bored with a specific book, not with the act of reading"
  - Taleb would read for 30-60 hours a week!
  - When you are bored, swap books - Do not stop reading though

## The Non-Linear and the Non-Linear

- All about how to detect antifragility
- Shocking something antifragile is beneficial, but depends on intensity
  - Fragile beings are harmed more by one large shock than many small ones
  - Antifragile beings benefit more from one large shock than many small ones
- Eating protein in a volatile manner (None on Monday and double on Wednesday) is better for you according to some studies - Find these studies
- Do not cross a river if it is on average 4 feet deep - If you are antifragile the average means very little to you
- Convexity - Average of f(x) is geater than f(average x)
- Optionality means you can be wrong a lot - Your payoffs are larger than the costs

## Via Negativa

- Going the way of what is wrong, not what is right
- Knowledge is subtractive, not additive (Grows by removing what is incorrect)
- Being wrong is an antifragile state, because you have the option to find out that you are right
- Do you have more than one reason for something? You might be convincing yourself to do it
- Lindy Effect: The old is predicted to outlast the young by proportion of their age
  - Reading the classic books will give you a far more lasting education then new big thing on the shelves now
- Classical texts last much longer - Antifragile knowledge
- Fragility on a small scale gives you antifragility on a large scale
  - Vaccinations
  - Evolution
- Taking the via negativa can mean getting rid of things you have - Less posessions = Happier

## The Ethics of Fragility and Antifragility

- Talking is a free option
- If you want to know what someone thinks, look in their portfolio
- Actions are larger than words
- Practice what you preach and you have nailed this chapter
- "The best way of checking whether you are alive is to see if you like variations"
