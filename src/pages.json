[{"pageName":"About","content":"\nIt's commonly said that explaining something helps you learn it, so you could say I'm selfishly using the this blog and its reader(s) for my own benefit.However, I prefer to think of it as an interested observer's perspective on how things work. I'll most likely focus my writing on the below topics, but no promises.\n\n- Economics & Finance - Mainly factor investing, statistical risk\n  premia, systematic trading and behavioural economics\n- Computer Science - Machine learning, website design, algorithm\n  design and general programming problems\n- Psychology - Behavioural biases and how both actions and habits\n  affect our brain\n\n- Chess\n- Poker\n\nSince starting work my little projects have taken a backseat, but the\nmain ones that I've worked on are:\n\n### Libry\n\nThis is a website I am working on with a friend of mine. The goal is\nto make a <i>good</i> online reading tracker and review tool. Sites\nlike goodreads are ancient in their architecture and must be improved\nupon, thats what we are trying to do. You can follow the development\non the [github page](https://github.com/barney-n/libry-frontend)\n\n### Nanovert\n\nI helped some friends create a company called [nanovert](https://www.nanovert.co.uk/) that allows 'nano-influencers' to get discount on things by posting social media stories of what they bought. I built the first iteration of the web app that companies used to log the visits of influencers. I'm not involved anymore.\n\n### This website\n\nBeyond those above, I spend time writing essays, tweaking code and\nimproving designs on my website.\n"}]
